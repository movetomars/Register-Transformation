PRIDE AND PREJUDICE

By Jane Austen



Chapter 1


It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession
of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.

However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his
first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds
of the surrounding families, that he is considered the rightful property
of some one or other of their daughters.

“my homie bennet :)” said his lady to him one day, “have you heard that
netherfield park is let finally?”

Mr. Bennet replied that he had not.

“but its,” returned she; “for that chick long has just been here, and she
told me all about it.”

Mr. Bennet made no answer.

“dont you want to know whos taken it?” cried his wife impatiently.

“_you_ want to tell me, and i have no objection to hearing it.”

This was invitation enough.

“why, my homie, you must know, that chick long says that netherfield is taken
by a fuccboi of large fortune from the north of england; that he came
down on monday in a ride and four to see the place, and was so much
happy with it, that he agreed with morris immediately; that he
will take possession before michaelmas, and some of his servants are to
be in the house by the end of next week.”

“what is his name?”

“bingley.”

“is he attached or single?”

“omg!! single, my homie, to be sure! a single guy of large fortune; four or
five thousand a year. what a fine thing for our girls :)”

“how so? how can it affect them?”

“my homie bennet :)” replied his wife, “how can you be so boring! you
must know that im thinking of his getting one of them.”

“is that his goal in settling here?”

“goal! nonsense, how can you talk so! but its ultra likely that he
_may_ fall in lovee with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as
soon as he comes.”

“i see no occasion for that. you and the girls may go, or you may send
them by themselves, which perhaps will be stil better, for as you are
as hottt as any of them, bingley may like you the best of the
party.”

“my homie, you flatter me. i totes _have_ had my share of hotttness, but
i do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now. when a woman has five
grown-up daughters, she should to give over thinking of her own hotttness.”

“in such cases, a woman has not often much hotttness to think of -.-”

“but, my homie, you must go and see bingley when he comes into
the hood.”

“its more than i engage for, i assure you :)”

“but consider your daughters. only think what an establishment itd
be for one of them. fam william and lucas are determined to
go, merely on that account, for in general, you know, they visit no
newcomers. you must go, for it will be impossible for _us_ to
visit him if you do not.”

“you are OCD, surely. i guess bingley will be very
happpy to see you; and i will send a DM by you to assure him of my
hearty consent to his getting whichever he chooses of the girls; though
i throw in a good word for my little lizzy.”

“i defame youll do no such thing. lizzy aint a bit better than the
others; and im sure she aint half so hottt as jane, nor half so
cheerful as lydia. but you are always giving _her_ the preference.”

“they have none of them much to recommend them,” replied he; “they are
all silly and ignorant like other girls; but lizzy has something more of
quickness than her sisters.”

“ bennet, how _can_ you abuse your own children in such a way? you
love in vexing me. youve no feels for my poor nerves.”

“you mistake me, my homie. i have a high respect for your nerves. they
are my old friends. i have heard you mention them with consideration
these last twenty years at least.”

“ah, you do not know what i suffer.”

“but i hope youll get over it, and live to see many young dudes of four
thousand a year come into the hood.”

“it will be no use to us, if twenty such should come, since youll not
visit them.”

“depend upon it, my homie, that when there are twenty, i will visit them
all.”

Mr. Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour,
reserve, and caprice, that the experience of three-and-twenty years had
been insufficient to make his wife understand his character. _Her_ mind
was less difficult to develop. She was a woman of mean understanding,
little information, and uncertain temper. When she was discontented,
she fancied herself nervous. The business of her life was to get her
daughters married; its solace was visiting and news.



Chapter 2


Mr. Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Mr. Bingley. He
had always intended to visit him, though to the last always assuring
his wife that he should not go; and till the evening after the visit was
paid she had no knowledge of it. It was then disclosed in the following
manner. Observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat, he
suddenly addressed her with:

“i hope bingley will like it, lizzy :)”

“we are not in a way to know _what_ bingley likes,” said her mother
resentfully, “since we are not to visit.”

“but you forget, mamma ;_;” said Elizabeth, “that well meet him at the
assemblies, and that that chick long promised to introduce him.”

“i do not believe that chick long will do any such thing. shes two nieces
of her own. shes a selfish, hypocritical woman, and i have no opinion
of her -.-”

“no more have i,” said Mr. Bennet; “and im happpy to find that you do
not depend on her serving you.”

Mrs. Bennet deigned not to make any reply, but, unable to contain
herself, began scolding one of her daughters.

“don't keep coughing so, kitty, for heaven's sake! have a little
feels on my nerves. you tear them to pieces.”

“kitty has no discretion in her coughs -.-” said her father; “she times
them ill.”

“i do not cough for my own amusement,” replied Kitty fretfully. “when is
your next ball to be, lizzy?”

“tomorrow fortnight.”

“yeah, so its,” cried her mother, “and that chick long does not come back
til the day before; so it will be impossible for her to introduce him,
for she will not know him herself.”

“then, my homie, you may have the advantage of your friend, and introduce
 bingley to _her_ :)”

“impossible, bennet, impossible, when im not acquainted with him
me; how can you be so teasing?”

“i honor your circumspection. a fortnight's acquaintance is totes
very little. one cant know what a guy really is by the end of a
fortnight. but if _we_ do not venture somebody else will; and after all,
that chick long and her neices must stand their chance; and, therefore, as
she will think it an act of kindness, if you turn down the office, i will
take it on me.”

The girls stared at their father. Mrs. Bennet said only, “nonsense,
nonsense!”

“what can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation?” cried he. “do
you consider the forms of introduction, and the stress thats laid on
them, as nonsense? i cant super agree with you _there_. whaddaya say,
mary? for you are a young of deep reflection, i know, and read
great books and write book reports.”

Mary wished to say something sensible, but knew not how.

“while mary is thinking about it,” he continued, “let us return to 
bingley.”

“im sick of bingley ;_;” cried his wife.

“im sorry to hear _that_; but why did not you tell me that before? if
i had known as much this morning i totes wouldnt have called
on him. its ultra unlucky; but as i have actually paid the visit, we
cant escape the acquaintance now.”

The astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished; that of Mrs.
Bennet perhaps surpassing the rest; though, when the first tumult of joy
was over, she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the
while.

“how good it was in you, my homie bennet! but i knew i should
persuade you finally. i was sure you loved your girls too well to
neglect such an acquaintance. well, how happyyy im! and its such a
good joke, too, that you gone this morning and never said a
word about it til now :)”

“now, kitty, you may cough as much as you choose,” said Mr. Bennet; and,
as he spoke, he left the room, fatigued with the raptures of his wife.

“what an excellent dad youve, girls :)” said she, when the door was
shut. “i do not know how youll ever make him amends for his kindness;
or me, either, for that matter. at our time of life it aint so
pleasant, i can tell you, to be making new acquaintances every day; but
for your sakes, we would do anything. lydia, my love, though you _are_
the youngest, i guess bingley will dance with you at the next
ball.”

“omg!!” said Lydia stoutly, “im not afraid; for though i _am_ the
youngest, i'm the tallest.”

The rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would
return Mr. Bennet's visit, and determining when they should ask him to
dinner.



Chapter 3


Not all that Mrs. Bennet, however, with the assistance of her five
daughters, could ask on the subject, was sufficient to draw from her
husband any satisfactory description of Mr. Bingley. They attacked him
in various ways--with barefaced questions, ingenious suppositions, and
distant surmises; but he eluded the skill of them all, and they were at
last obliged to accept the second-hand intelligence of their neighbour,
Lady Lucas. Her report was highly favourable. Sir William had been
delighted with him. He was quite young, wonderfully handsome, extremely
agreeable, and, to crown the whole, he meant to be at the next assembly
with a large party. Nothing could be more delightful! To be fond of
dancing was a certain step towards falling in love; and very lively
hopes of Mr. Bingley's heart were entertained.

“if i can but see one of my daughters happily settled at netherfield :)”
 said Mrs. Bennet to her husband, “and all the others equally well
attached, i will have nothing to wish for.”

In a few days Mr. Bingley returned Mr. Bennet's visit, and sat about
ten minutes with him in his library. He had entertained hopes of being
admitted to a sight of the young ladies, of whose beauty he had
heard much; but he saw only the father. The ladies were somewhat more
fortunate, for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper
window that he wore a blue coat, and rode a black horse.

An invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched; and already
had Mrs. Bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her
housekeeping, when an answer arrived which deferred it all. Mr. Bingley
was obliged to be in town the following day, and, consequently, unable
to accept the honour of their invitation, etc. Mrs. Bennet was quite
disconcerted. She could not imagine what business he could have in town
so soon after his arrival in Hertfordshire; and she began to fear that
he might be always flying about from one place to another, and never
settled at Netherfield as he ought to be. Lady Lucas quieted her fears
a little by starting the idea of his being gone to London only to get
a large party for the ball; and a report soon followed that Mr. Bingley
was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly.
The girls grieved over such a number of ladies, but were comforted the
day before the ball by hearing, that instead of twelve he brought only
six with him from London--his five sisters and a cousin. And when
the party entered the assembly room it consisted of only five
altogether--Mr. Bingley, his two sisters, the husband of the eldest, and
another young man.

Mr. Bingley was good-looking and gentlemanlike; he had a pleasant
countenance, and easy, unaffected manners. His sisters were fine women,
with an air of decided fashion. His brother-in-law, Mr. Hurst, merely
looked the gentleman; but his friend Mr. Darcy soon drew the attention
of the room by his fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien, and
the report which was in general circulation within five minutes
after his entrance, of his having ten thousand a year. The gentlemen
pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man, the ladies declared he
was much handsomer than Mr. Bingley, and he was looked at with great
admiration for about half the evening, till his manners gave a disgust
which turned the tide of his popularity; for he was discovered to be
proud; to be above his company, and above being pleased; and not all
his large estate in Derbyshire could then save him from having a most
forbidding, disagreeable countenance, and being unworthy to be compared
with his friend.

Mr. Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal
people in the room; he was lively and unreserved, danced every dance,
was angry that the ball closed so early, and talked of giving
one himself at Netherfield. Such amiable qualities must speak for
themselves. What a contrast between him and his friend! Mr. Darcy danced
only once with Mrs. Hurst and once with Miss Bingley, declined being
introduced to any other lady, and spent the rest of the evening in
walking about the room, speaking occasionally to one of his own party.
His character was decided. He was the proudest, most disagreeable man
in the world, and everybody hoped that he would never come there again.
Amongst the most violent against him was Mrs. Bennet, whose dislike of
his general behaviour was sharpened into particular resentment by his
having slighted one of her daughters.

Elizabeth Bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of gentlemen, to sit
down for two dances; and during part of that time, Mr. Darcy had been
standing near enough for her to hear a conversation between him and Mr.
Bingley, who came from the dance for a few minutes, to press his friend
to join it.

“come, darcy,” said he, “i have you dance. i hate to see you
standing about by yourself in this stupid way. you had much better
dance -.-”

“i totes will not. you know how i hate it, unless im
particularly acquainted with my partner. at such a party as this
itd be insupportable. your sisters are hookin up on the regs, and there is not
another woman in the room who itdnt be a punishment to me to
stand up with.”

“i wouldnt be so picky af as you are,” cried Mr. Bingley, “for a
kingdom! upon my honor, i never met with so many pleasant girls in
my life as i have this night; and there are several of them you see
uncommonly pretty.”

“_you_ are twerkin with the only hottt girl in the room,” said Mr.
Darcy, looking at the eldest Miss Bennet.

“omg!! shes the craziest gorgeous creature i ever beheld! but there is one
of her sisters sitting down just behind you, whos ultra pretty, and i
dare say ultra agreeable. do let me ask my partner to introduce you :)”

“which do you mean?” and turning round he looked for a moment at
Elizabeth, till catching her eye, he withdrew his own and coldly said:
“she willlerable, but not hottt enough to tempt _me_; im in no
humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted
by other men. you oughta return to your partner and enjoy her
smiles, for you are wasting your time with me.”

Mr. Bingley followed his advice. Mr. Darcy walked off; and Elizabeth
remained with no very cordial feelings toward him. She told the story,
however, with great spirit among her friends; for she had a lively,
playful disposition, which delighted in anything ridiculous.

The evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family. Mrs.
Bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the Netherfield
party. Mr. Bingley had danced with her twice, and she had been
distinguished by his sisters. Jane was as much gratified by this as
her mother could be, though in a quieter way. Elizabeth felt Jane's
pleasure. Mary had heard herself mentioned to Miss Bingley as the most
accomplished girl in the neighbourhood; and Catherine and Lydia had been
fortunate enough never to be without partners, which was all that they
had yet learnt to care for at a ball. They returned, therefore, in good
spirits to Longbourn, the village where they lived, and of which they
were the principal inhabitants. They found Mr. Bennet still up. With
a book he was regardless of time; and on the present occasion he had a
good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised
such splendid expectations. He had rather hoped that his wife's views on
the stranger would be disappointed; but he soon found out that he had a
different story to hear.

“omg!! my homie bennet :)” as she entered the room, “we have had a most
awesome night, a craziest excellent ball. i wish you had been there.
jane was so admired, nothing could be like it. errbody said how well
she looked; and bingley thought her super gorgeous, and danced with
her twice! only think of _that_, my homie; he actually danced with her
twice! and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second
time. first of all, he asked lucas. i was so vexed to see him stand
up with her! but he did not admire her at all; , nobody
can, you know; and he seemed super struck with jane as she was going
down the dance. so he inquired who she was, and got introduced, and
asked her for the two next. then the two third he danced with king,
and the two fourth with maria lucas, and the two fifth with jane again,
and the two sixth with lizzy, and the _boulanger_--”

“if he had had any feels for _me_ :)” cried her husband impatiently,
“lol he wouldnt have danced half so much! for god's sake, say no more of
his partners. whaaaaat that he had sprained his ankle in the first dance!”

“omg!! my homie, im super happy with him. he is so crazy highly
hottt! and his sisters are charming women. i never in my life saw
anything more elegant than their dresses. i guess the lace upon that chick
hurst's gown- :)”

Here she was interrupted again. Mr. Bennet protested against any
description of finery. She was therefore obliged to seek another branch
of the subject, and related, with much bitterness of spirit and some
exaggeration, the shocking rudeness of Mr. Darcy.

“but i can assure you :)” she added, “that lizzy does not lose much by not
suiting _his_ fancy; for he is a craziest disagreeable, horrid man, not at
all worth pleasing. so high and so conceited that there was no enduring
him! he walked here, and he walked there, fancying himself so very
great! not hottt enough to dance with! i wish you had been there, my
dear, to have given him one of your set-downs. i super hate the man.”



Chapter 4


When Jane and Elizabeth were alone, the former, who had been cautious in
her praise of Mr. Bingley before, expressed to her sister just how very
much she admired him.

“he is just what a fuccboi should to be,” said she, “sensible,
cheerful, fun; and i never saw such happy ways!--so much
ease, with such perfect good breeding :)”

“he is also hottt,” replied Elizabeth, “which a fuccboi ought
likewise to be, if he possibly can. his personality is thereby complete.”

“i was ultra much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time. i
did not expect such a compliment.”

“did not you? i did for you. but thats one great difference between
us. compliments always take _you_ by surprise, and _me_ never. what
could be more natural than his asking you again? he couldnt help
seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman
in the room. no thanks to his gallantry for that. well, he totes is
very agreeable, and i give you leave to like him. youve liked many a
stupider person :)”

“dear lizzy!”

“omg!! you are a great deal too apt, you know, to like people in general.
you never see a fault in anybody. all the world are good and agreeable
in your eyeah. i never heard you speak sick of a human being in your
life :)”

“i wouldnt wish to be hasty in censuring anyone; but i always speak
what i think.”

“i know you do; and its _that_ which makes the wonder. with _your_
good sense, to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of
others! affectation of candour is common enough--one meets with it
everywhere. but to be candid without ostentation or goal--to take the
good of errbody's personality and make it stil better, and say nothing
of the bad--belongs to you alone. and so you like this man's sisters,
too, do you? their ways are not equal to his.”

“totes not--at first. but they are ultra pleasing women when you
converse with them. bingley will live with her bro, and keep
his house; and im much wrong if well not find a ultra charming
neighbour in her.”

Elizabeth listened in silence, but was not convinced; their behaviour at
the assembly had not been calculated to please in general; and with more
quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister,
and with a judgement too unassailed by any attention to herself, she
was very little disposed to approve them. They were in fact very fine
ladies; not deficient in good humour when they were pleased, nor in the
power of making themselves agreeable when they chose it, but proud and
conceited. They were rather handsome, had been educated in one of the
first private seminaries in town, had a fortune of twenty thousand
pounds, were in the habit of spending more than they ought, and of
associating with people of rank, and were therefore in every respect
entitled to think well of themselves, and meanly of others. They were of
a respectable family in the north of England; a circumstance more deeply
impressed on their memories than that their brother's fortune and their
own had been acquired by trade.

Mr. Bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly a hundred
thousand pounds from his father, who had intended to purchase an
estate, but did not live to do it. Mr. Bingley intended it likewise, and
sometimes made choice of his county; but as he was now provided with a
good house and the liberty of a manor, it was doubtful to many of those
who best knew the easiness of his temper, whether he might not spend the
remainder of his days at Netherfield, and leave the next generation to
purchase.

His sisters were anxious for his having an estate of his own; but,
though he was now only established as a tenant, Miss Bingley was by no
means unwilling to preside at his table--nor was Mrs. Hurst, who had
married a man of more fashion than fortune, less disposed to consider
his house as her home when it suited her. Mr. Bingley had not been of
age two years, when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation
to look at Netherfield House. He did look at it, and into it for
half-an-hour--was pleased with the situation and the principal
rooms, satisfied with what the owner said in its praise, and took it
immediately.

Between him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship, in spite of
great opposition of character. Bingley was endeared to Darcy by the
easiness, openness, and ductility of his temper, though no disposition
could offer a greater contrast to his own, and though with his own he
never appeared dissatisfied. On the strength of Darcy's regard, Bingley
had the firmest reliance, and of his judgement the highest opinion.
In understanding, Darcy was the superior. Bingley was by no means
deficient, but Darcy was clever. He was at the same time haughty,
reserved, and fastidious, and his manners, though well-bred, were not
inviting. In that respect his friend had greatly the advantage. Bingley
was sure of being liked wherever he appeared, Darcy was continually
giving offense.

The manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly was sufficiently
characteristic. Bingley had never met with more pleasant people or
prettier girls in his life; everybody had been most kind and attentive
to him; there had been no formality, no stiffness; he had soon felt
acquainted with all the room; and, as to Miss Bennet, he could not
conceive an angel more beautiful. Darcy, on the contrary, had seen a
collection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion, for
none of whom he had felt the smallest interest, and from none received
either attention or pleasure. Miss Bennet he acknowledged to be pretty,
but she smiled too much.

Mrs. Hurst and her sister allowed it to be so--but still they admired
her and liked her, and pronounced her to be a sweet girl, and one
whom they would not object to know more of. Miss Bennet was therefore
established as a sweet girl, and their brother felt authorized by such
commendation to think of her as he chose.



Chapter 5


Within a short walk of Longbourn lived a family with whom the Bennets
were particularly intimate. Sir William Lucas had been formerly in trade
in Meryton, where he had made a tolerable fortune, and risen to the
honour of knighthood by an address to the king during his mayoralty.
The distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly. It had given him a
disgust to his business, and to his residence in a small market town;
and, in quitting them both, he had removed with his family to a house
about a mile from Meryton, denominated from that period Lucas Lodge,
where he could think with pleasure of his own importance, and,
unshackled by business, occupy himself solely in being civil to all
the world. For, though elated by his rank, it did not render him
supercilious; on the contrary, he was all attention to everybody. By
nature inoffensive, friendly, and obliging, his presentation at St.
James's had made him courteous.

Lady Lucas was a very good kind of woman, not too clever to be a
valuable neighbour to Mrs. Bennet. They had several children. The eldest
of them, a sensible, intelligent young woman, about twenty-seven, was
Elizabeth's intimate friend.

That the Miss Lucases and the Miss Bennets should meet to talk over
a ball was absolutely necessary; and the morning after the assembly
brought the former to Longbourn to hear and to communicate.

“_you_ began the night well, charlotte :)” said Mrs. Bennet with civil
self-command to Miss Lucas. “_you_ were bingley's first choice.”

“yeah; but he seemed to like his second better :)”

“omg!! you mean jane, i suppose, because he danced with her twice. to be
sure that _did_ seem as if he admired her-- i kinda believe he
_did_--i heard something about it--but i barely know what--something
about robinson.”

“perhaps you mean what i overheard between him and robinson; did not
i mention it to you? robinson's asking him how he liked our meryton
assemblies, and whether he did not think there were a great many
pretty women in the room, and _which_ he thought the prettiest? and his
answering immediately to the last question: 'omg!! the oldest bennet,
beyond a doubt; there cant be two opinions on that point.'”

“upon my word! well, thats ultra decided --that does seem as
if--but it may all come to nothing, you know.”

“_my_ overhearings were more to the purpose than _yours_, eliza,” said
Charlotte. “ darcy aint so well worth listening to as his friend,
is he?--poor eliza!--to be only just _aight_.”

“i beg you wouldnt put it into lizzy's head to be vexed by his
ill-treatment, for he is such a disagreeable man, that itd be super
a misfortune to be liked by him. that chick long told me last night that he
sat close to her for half-an-hour without once opening his lips.”

“are you super sure, ma'am?--is not there a little mistake :)” said Jane.
“i totes saw darcy speaking to her :)”

“yeah--because she asked him finally how he liked netherfield, and he
couldnt help answering her; but she said he seemed super angry at
being spoke to.”

“miss bingley told me,” said Jane, “that he never speaks much,
unless among his intimate acquaintances. with _them_ he is remarkably
agreeable.”

“i do not believe a word , my homie. if he had been so very
agreeable, he wouldve talked to that chick long. but i can guess how it
was; errbody says that he is eat up with ego, and i guess he had
heard somehow that that chick long does not keep a ride, and had come to
the ball in a hack ride.”

“i do not mind his not talking to that chick long,” said Miss Lucas, “but i
wish he had danced with eliza :)”

“another time, lizzy,” said her mother, “i wouldnt dance with _him_,
if i were you.”

“i believe, ma'am, i may safely promise you _never_ to dance with him :)”

“his ego,” said Miss Lucas, “does not offend _me_ so much as ego
often does, because there is an excuse for it. one cant wonder that so
very fine a fuccboi, with fam, fortune, everything in his favour,
should think highly of himself. if i may so express it, hes a _right_
to be proud.”

“thats ultra true,” replied Elizabeth, “and i could easily forgive
_his_ ego, if he hadnt mortified _mine_ :)”

“ego,” observed Mary, who piqued herself upon the solidity of her
reflections, “is a ultra common failing, i believe. by all that i have
ever read, im convinced that its ultra common ; that human
nature is particularly prone to it, and that there are ultra few of us
who do not cherish a feeling of self-complacency on the score of some
quality or other, real or imaginary. vanity and ego are different
things, though the words are often used synonymously. a person may
be proud without being vain. ego relates more to our opinion of
ourselves, vanity to what we wouldve others think of us.”

“if i were as rich as darcy :)” cried a young Lucas, who came with
his sisters, “i should not care how proud i was. i would keep a pack of
foxhounds, and drink a bottle of wine a day -.-”

“then you would drink a great deal more than you should :)” said Mrs.
Bennet; “and if i were to see you at it, i should take away your bottle
directly.”

The boy protested that she should not; she continued to declare that she
would, and the argument ended only with the visit.



Chapter 6


The ladies of Longbourn soon waited on those of Netherfield. The visit
was soon returned in due form. Miss Bennet's pleasing manners grew on
the goodwill of Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley; and though the mother was
found to be intolerable, and the younger sisters not worth speaking to,
a wish of being better acquainted with _them_ was expressed towards
the two eldest. By Jane, this attention was received with the greatest
pleasure, but Elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment
of everybody, hardly excepting even her sister, and could not like them;
though their kindness to Jane, such as it was, had a value as arising in
all probability from the influence of their brother's admiration. It
was generally evident whenever they met, that he _did_ admire her and
to _her_ it was equally evident that Jane was yielding to the preference
which she had begun to entertain for him from the first, and was in a
way to be very much in love; but she considered with pleasure that it
was not likely to be discovered by the world in general, since Jane
united, with great strength of feeling, a composure of temper and a
uniform cheerfulness of manner which would guard her from the suspicions
of the impertinent. She mentioned this to her friend Miss Lucas.

“it may perhaps be pleasant,” replied Charlotte, “to be able to impose
on the public in such a case; but its sometimes a disadvantage to be
so ultra guarded. if a woman conceals her luvwith the same skill
from the object , she may lose the opportunity of fixing him; and
it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in
the dark. there is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every
attachment, that it aint safe to leave any to itself. we can all
_begin_ freely--a slight preference is natural enough; but there are
very few of us who have heart enough to be really in lovee without
sign. in nine cases out of ten a women oughta show _more_
luvthan she feels. bingley likes your sis undoubtedly; but he
may never do more than like her, if she does not help him on.”

“but she does help him on, as much as her nature will allow. if i can
perceive her regard for him, he must be a simpleton, , not to
discover it too.”

“remember, eliza, that he does not know jane's personality as you do.”

“but if a woman is partial to a man, and does not try to conceal
it, he must find it out.”

“perhaps he must, if he sees enough of her. but, though bingley and jane
meet kinda often, its never for many hours together; and, as they
always see each other in large mixed parties, its impossible that
every moment should be employed in conversing together. jane should
therefore make the craziest of every half-hour in which she can command his
attention. when shes secure of him, there will be more leisure for
falling in lovee as much as she chooses.”

“your plan is a good one :)” replied Elizabeth, “where nothing is in
question but the defame of being well attached, and if i were determined
to get a rich husband, or any husband, i guess i should adopt it. but
these are not jane's feels; she aint acting by goal. as yet,
she cant even be certain of the degree of her own regard nor s
reasonableness. shes known him only a fortnight. she danced four
dances with him at meryton; she saw him one morning at his own house,
and has since dined with him in company four times. this aint super
enough to make her understand his personality.”

“not as you represent it. had she merely _dined_ with him, she might
only have discovered whether he had a good appetite; but you must
remember that four nights have also been spent together--and four
nights may do a great deal.”

“yeah; these four nights have enabled them to ascertain that they
both like vingt-un better than commerce; but with respect to any other
leading personalityistic, i do not imagine that much has been unfolded.”

“well,” said Charlotte, “i wish jane success with all my heart; and
if she were attached to him tomorrow, i should think she had as good a
chance of happiness as if she were to be studying his personality for a
twelvemonth. happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance. if
the personalitys of the parties are ever so well known to each other or
ever so similar beforehand, it does not advance their felicity in the
least. they always continue to grow sufficiently unlike after that to
have their share of pissiness; and its better to know as little as
possible of the defects of the person with who you are to pass your
life.”

“you make me laugh, charlotte; but it aint sound. you know its not
sound, and that you would never act in this way yourself lol”

Occupied in observing Mr. Bingley's attentions to her sister, Elizabeth
was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some
interest in the eyes of his friend. Mr. Darcy had at first scarcely
allowed her to be pretty; he had looked at her without admiration at the
ball; and when they next met, he looked at her only to criticise. But no
sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she hardly
had a good feature in her face, than he began to find it was rendered
uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes. To
this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying. Though he had
detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry
in her form, he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and
pleasing; and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those
of the fashionable world, he was caught by their easy playfulness. Of
this she was perfectly unaware; to her he was only the man who made
himself agreeable nowhere, and who had not thought her handsome enough
to dance with.

He began to wish to know more of her, and as a step towards conversing
with her himself, attended to her conversation with others. His doing so
drew her notice. It was at Sir William Lucas's, where a large party were
assembled.

“what does darcy mean,” said she to Charlotte, “by listening to my
conversation with colonel forster?”

“thats a question which darcy only can answer.”

“but if he does it any more i will totes let him know that i see
what he is about. hes a ultra satirical eye, and if i do not begin by
being impertinent me, i will soon grow afraid of him lol”

On his approaching them soon afterwards, though without seeming to have
any intention of speaking, Miss Lucas defied her friend to mention such
a subject to him; which immediately provoking Elizabeth to do it, she
turned to him and said:

“did you not think, darcy, that i expressed me uncommonly
well just now, when i was teasing colonel forster to give us a ball at
meryton?”

“with great energy; but its always a subject which makes a 
energetic :)”

“you are severe on us ;_;”

“it will be _her_ turn soon to be teased,” said Miss Lucas. “im going
to open the instrument, eliza, and you know what follows.”

“you are a ultra strange creature by way of a friend!--always wanting me
to play and sing before anybody and errbody! if my vanity had taken
a musical turn, you wouldve been invaluable; but as its, i would
really kinda not sit down before those who must be in the habit of
hearing the ultra best performers.” On Miss Lucas's persevering, however,
she added, “very well, if it must be so, it must.” And gravely glancing
at Mr. Darcy, “there is a fine old saying, which errbody here is of
course familiar with: 'keep your breath to cool your porridge'; and i
will keep mine to swell my song.”

Her performance was pleasing, though by no means capital. After a song
or two, and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that
she would sing again, she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her
sister Mary, who having, in consequence of being the only plain one in
the family, worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments, was always
impatient for display.

Mary had neither genius nor taste; and though vanity had given her
application, it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited
manner, which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she
had reached. Elizabeth, easy and unaffected, had been listened to with
much more pleasure, though not playing half so well; and Mary, at the
end of a long concerto, was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by
Scotch and Irish airs, at the request of her younger sisters, who,
with some of the Lucases, and two or three officers, joined eagerly in
dancing at one end of the room.

Mr. Darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of
passing the evening, to the exclusion of all conversation, and was too
much engrossed by his thoughts to perceive that Sir William Lucas was
his neighbour, till Sir William thus began:

“what a charming amusement for young people this is, darcy! there
is nothing like twerkin after all. i consider it as one of the first
refinements of polished society.”

“totes, fam; and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst
the less polished societies of the world. every savage can dance.”

Sir William only smiled. “your friend performs awesomely w00t!” he
continued after a pause, on seeing Bingley join the group; “and i doubt
not that you are an adept in the science yourself, darcy.”

“you saw me dance at meryton, i believe, fam.”

“yeah, , and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight. do
you often dance at st. james's?”

“never, fam.”

“dont you think itd be a proper compliment to the place?”

“its a compliment which i never pay to any place if i can avoid it :)”

“youve a house in town, i conclude?”

Mr. Darcy bowed.

“i had once had some thought of fixing in town me--for im fond
of superior society; but i did not feel super certain that the air of
london would agree with lucas.”

He paused in hopes of an answer; but his companion was not disposed
to make any; and Elizabeth at that instant moving towards them, he was
struck with the action of doing a very gallant thing, and called out to
her:

“my homie eliza, why are you not twerkin? darcy, you must allow
me to present this young to you as a ultra defamable partner. you
cant refuse to dance, im sure when so much hotttness is before you :)”
 And, taking her hand, he would have given it to Mr. Darcy who, though
extremely surprised, was not unwilling to receive it, when she instantly
drew back, and said with some discomposure to Sir William:

“, fam, i dont have the least intention of twerkin. i entreat you
not to suppose that i moved this way in order to beg for a partner.”

Mr. Darcy, with grave propriety, requested to be allowed the honour of
her hand, but in vain. Elizabeth was determined; nor did Sir William at
all shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion.

“you excel so much in the dance, eliza, that its cruel to deny
me the happiness of seeing you; and though this dude dislikes the
amusement in general, he can have no objection, im sure, to oblige us
for one half-hour -.-”

“ darcy is all politeness,” said Elizabeth, smiling.

“he is, ; but, considering the inducement, my homie eliza,
we cant care about his complaisance--for who would object to such a
partner?”

Elizabeth looked archly, and turned away. Her resistance had not
injured her with the gentleman, and he was thinking of her with some
complacency, when thus accosted by Miss Bingley:

“i can guess the subject of your reverie.”

“i should imagine not.”

“you are considering how insupportable itd be to pass many nights
in this way--in such society; and im super of your opinion.
i was never more annoyed! the insipidity, and yet the noise--the
nothingness, and yet the self-importance of all those people! what would
i give to hear your strictures on them lol”

“your conjecture willtally wrong, i assure you. my mind was more
agreeably hookin up on the regs. i have been meditating on the ultra great pleasure
which a pair of fine eyeah in the face of a pretty woman can bestow :)”

Miss Bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face, and desired he
would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections.
Mr. Darcy replied with great intrepidity:

“miss elizabeth bennet.”

“miss elizabeth bennet!” repeated Miss Bingley. “im all astonishment.
how long has she been such a fave?--and pray, when am i to wish you
joy :)”

“thats right only the question which i expected you to ask. a 's
imagination is ultra rapid; it jumps from admiration to love, from love
to matrimony, in a moment. i knew you would be wishing me joy :)”

“nay, if you are serious about it, i will consider this shits
absolutely settled. youll be having a charming mom-in-law, ;
and, of course, she will always be at pemberley with you.”

He listened to her with perfect indifference while she chose to
entertain herself in this manner; and as his composure convinced her
that all was safe, her wit flowed long.



Chapter 7


Mr. Bennet's property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two
thousand a year, which, unfortunately for his daughters, was entailed,
in default of heirs male, on a distant relation; and their mother's
fortune, though ample for her situation in life, could but ill supply
the deficiency of his. Her father had been an attorney in Meryton, and
had left her four thousand pounds.

She had a sister married to a Mr. Phillips, who had been a clerk to
their father and succeeded him in the business, and a brother settled in
London in a respectable line of trade.

The village of Longbourn was only one mile from Meryton; a most
convenient distance for the young ladies, who were usually tempted
thither three or four times a week, to pay their duty to their aunt and
to a milliner's shop just over the way. The two youngest of the family,
Catherine and Lydia, were particularly frequent in these attentions;
their minds were more vacant than their sisters', and when nothing
better offered, a walk to Meryton was necessary to amuse their morning
hours and furnish conversation for the evening; and however bare of news
the country in general might be, they always contrived to learn some
from their aunt. At present, indeed, they were well supplied both with
news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the
neighbourhood; it was to remain the whole winter, and Meryton was the
headquarters.

Their visits to Mrs. Phillips were now productive of the most
interesting intelligence. Every day added something to their knowledge
of the officers' names and connections. Their lodgings were not long a
secret, and at length they began to know the officers themselves. Mr.
Phillips visited them all, and this opened to his nieces a store of
felicity unknown before. They could talk of nothing but officers; and
Mr. Bingley's large fortune, the mention of which gave animation
to their mother, was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the
regimentals of an ensign.

After listening one morning to their effusions on this subject, Mr.
Bennet coolly observed:

“from all that i can collect by your way of talking, you must be two
of the silliest girls in the country. i have suspected it some time, but
im now convinced.”

Catherine was disconcerted, and made no answer; but Lydia, with perfect
indifference, continued to express her admiration of Captain Carter,
and her hope of seeing him in the course of the day, as he was going the
next morning to London.

“im shook, my homie :)” said Mrs. Bennet, “that you should be so
ready to think your own children silly. if i wished to think slightingly
of anybody's children, it should not be of my own, however.”

“if my children are silly, i hope to be always sensible :)”

“yeah--but as it happens, they are all of them ultra clever.”

“this is the only point, i flatter me, on which we do not agree. i
had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular, but i
so far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly
foolish.”

“my homie bennet, you must not expect such girls to have the sense of
their dad and mom. when they get to our age, i guess they will
not think about officers any more than we do. i remember the time when
i liked a red coat me ultra well--and, , so i do stil at my
heart; and if a smart young colonel, with five or six thousand a year,
should want one of my girls i will not say nay to him; and i thought
colonel forster looked ultra becomin the other night at fam william's in
his regimentals lol”

“mamma,” cried Lydia, “lol my aunt says that colonel forster and captain
carter do not go so often to watson's as they did when they first
came; she sees them now ultra often standing in clarke's library.”

Mrs. Bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with
a note for Miss Bennet; it came from Netherfield, and the servant waited
for an answer. Mrs. Bennet's eyes sparkled with pleasure, and she was
eagerly calling out, while her daughter read,

“well, jane, whos it from? what is it about? what does he say? well,
jane, make haste and tell us; make haste, my lovee lol”

“its from bingley -.-” said Jane, and then read it aloud.

“MY DEAR FRIEND,--

“If you are not so compassionate as to dine to-day with Louisa and me,
we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our lives,
for a whole day's tete-a-tete between two women can never end without a
quarrel. Come as soon as you can on receipt of this. My brother and the
gentlemen are to dine with the officers.--Yours ever,

“caroline bingley”

“with the officers!” cried Lydia. “i wonder my aunt did not tell us of
_that_.”

“dining out,” said Mrs. Bennet, “thats ultra unlucky.”

“can i have the ride?” said Jane.

“no, my homie, you oughta go on horseback, because it seems likely to
rain; then you must stay all night.”

“that would be a good scheme :)” said Elizabeth, “if you were sure that
they wouldnt offer to send her home.”

“omg!! but the gentlemen will have bingley's ride to go to meryton,
and the hursts have no horses to theirs.”

“i had much kinda go in the coach.”

“but, my homie, your dad cant spare the horses, im sure. they are
wanted in the farm, bennet, are they not?”

“they are wanted in the farm much oftener than i can get them.”

“but if youve got them to-day,” said Elizabeth, “my mom's purpose
will be answered.”

She did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses
were engaged. Jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback, and her
mother attended her to the door with many cheerful prognostics of a
bad day. Her hopes were answered; Jane had not been gone long before
it rained hard. Her sisters were uneasy for her, but her mother was
delighted. The rain continued the whole evening without intermission;
Jane certainly could not come back.

“this was a lucky idea of mine, :)” said Mrs. Bennet more than
once, as if the credit of making it rain were all her own. Till the
next morning, however, she was not aware of all the felicity of her
contrivance. Breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from Netherfield
brought the following note for Elizabeth:

“MY DEAREST LIZZY,--

“i find me ultra unwell this morning, which, i suppose, will be
imputed to my getting wet through yeahterday. my kind friends will not
hear of my returning til im better. they insist also on my seeing 
jones--therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear of his having been
to me--and, excepting a sore throat and headache, there aint much the
matter with me.--yours, etc.”

“well, my homie,” said Mr. Bennet, when Elizabeth had read the note
aloud, “if your daughter a dangerous fit of illness--if she
should die, itd be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of
 bingley, and under your orders.”

“omg!! im not afraid of her dying. people do not die of little trifling
colds. she will be taken good care of. as long as she stays there, its
all ultra well. i would go and see her if i could have the ride.”

Elizabeth, feeling really anxious, was determined to go to her, though
the carriage was not to be had; and as she was no horsewoman, walking
was her only alternative. She declared her resolution.

“how can you be so silly,” cried her mother, “as to think of such a
thing, in all this dirt! youll not be fit to be seen when you get
there -.-”

“i will be ultra fit to see jane--which is all i want.”

“is this a hint to me, lizzy,” said her father, “to send for the
horses?”

“no, , i do not wish to avoid the walk. the distance is nothing
when one has a motive; only three miles. i will be back by dinner.”

“i admire the activity of your benevolence :)” observed Mary, “but every
impulse of feeling should be guided by reason; and, in my opinion,
exertion should always be in proportion to what is required lol”

“well go as far as meryton with you,” said Catherine and Lydia.
Elizabeth accepted their company, and the three young ladies set off
together.

“if we make haste,” said Lydia, as they walked along, “perhaps we may
see something of captain carter before he goes.”

In Meryton they parted; the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one
of the officers' wives, and Elizabeth continued her walk alone, crossing
field after field at a quick pace, jumping over stiles and springing
over puddles with impatient activity, and finding herself at last
within view of the house, with weary ankles, dirty stockings, and a face
glowing with the warmth of exercise.

She was shown into the breakfast-parlour, where all but Jane were
assembled, and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise.
That she should have walked three miles so early in the day, in such
dirty weather, and by herself, was almost incredible to Mrs. Hurst and
Miss Bingley; and Elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt
for it. She was received, however, very politely by them; and in their
brother's manners there was something better than politeness; there
was good humour and kindness. Mr. Darcy said very little, and Mr.
Hurst nothing at all. The former was divided between admiration of the
brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion, and doubt as
to the occasion's justifying her coming so far alone. The latter was
thinking only of his breakfast.

Her inquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered. Miss
Bennet had slept ill, and though up, was very feverish, and not
well enough to leave her room. Elizabeth was glad to be taken to her
immediately; and Jane, who had only been withheld by the fear of giving
alarm or inconvenience from expressing in her note how much she longed
for such a visit, was delighted at her entrance. She was not equal,
however, to much conversation, and when Miss Bingley left them
together, could attempt little besides expressions of gratitude for the
extraordinary kindness she was treated with. Elizabeth silently attended
her.

When breakfast was over they were joined by the sisters; and Elizabeth
began to like them herself, when she saw how much affection and
solicitude they showed for Jane. The apothecary came, and having
examined his patient, said, as might be supposed, that she had caught
a violent cold, and that they must endeavour to get the better of it;
advised her to return to bed, and promised her some draughts. The advice
was followed readily, for the feverish symptoms increased, and her head
ached acutely. Elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment; nor were
the other ladies often absent; the gentlemen being out, they had, in
fact, nothing to do elsewhere.

When the clock struck three, Elizabeth felt that she must go, and very
unwillingly said so. Miss Bingley offered her the carriage, and she only
wanted a little pressing to accept it, when Jane testified such concern
in parting with her, that Miss Bingley was obliged to convert the offer
of the chaise to an invitation to remain at Netherfield for the present.
Elizabeth most thankfully consented, and a servant was dispatched to
Longbourn to acquaint the family with her stay and bring back a supply
of clothes.



Chapter 8


At five o'clock the two ladies retired to dress, and at half-past six
Elizabeth was summoned to dinner. To the civil inquiries which then
poured in, and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the
much superior solicitude of Mr. Bingley's, she could not make a very
favourable answer. Jane was by no means better. The sisters, on hearing
this, repeated three or four times how much they were grieved, how
shocking it was to have a bad cold, and how excessively they disliked
being ill themselves; and then thought no more of the matter: and their
indifference towards Jane when not immediately before them restored
Elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her former dislike.

Their brother, indeed, was the only one of the party whom she could
regard with any complacency. His anxiety for Jane was evident, and his
attentions to herself most pleasing, and they prevented her feeling
herself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the
others. She had very little notice from any but him. Miss Bingley was
engrossed by Mr. Darcy, her sister scarcely less so; and as for Mr.
Hurst, by whom Elizabeth sat, he was an indolent man, who lived only to
eat, drink, and play at cards; who, when he found her to prefer a plain
dish to a ragout, had nothing to say to her.

When dinner was over, she returned directly to Jane, and Miss Bingley
began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room. Her manners were
pronounced to be very bad indeed, a mixture of pride and impertinence;
she had no conversation, no style, no beauty. Mrs. Hurst thought the
same, and added:

“shes nothing, in short, to recommend her, but being an excellent
walker. i will never forget her looks this morning. she really
looked almost wild :)”

“she did, , louisa. i could barely keep my face. very
nonsensical to come at all! why must _she_ be scampering about the
country, because her sis had a cold? her hair, so untidy, so fucked up!”

“yeah, and her shorts; i hope you saw her shorts, six inches deep
in mud, im absolutely certain; and the gown which had been let down to
hide it not doing its office.”

“your picture may be ultra right on, louisa,” said Bingley; “but this was
all lost upon me. i thought elizabeth bennet looked remarkably
well when she came in the room this morning. her dirty shorts super
escaped my notice.”

“_you_ observed it, darcy, im sure,” said Miss Bingley; “and im
inclined to think that you wouldnt wish to see _your_ sis make such
an exhibition.”

“totes not.”

“to walk three miles, or four miles, or five miles, or whatever its,
above her ankles in dirt, and alone, super alone! what could she mean by
it? it seems to me to show an abominable sort of conceited independence,
a craziest ratchet indifference to decorum.”

“it shows an luvfor her sis thats ultra pleasing :)” said
Bingley.

“im afraid, darcy,” observed Miss Bingley in a half whisper, “that
this adventure has kinda affected your admiration of her fine eyeah :)”

“not at all,” he replied; “they were brightened by the exercise :)” A
short pause followed this speech, and Mrs. Hurst began again:

“i have an crazy high regard for jane bennet, shes really a very
sweet girl, and i wish with all my heart she were settled down. but with
such a dad and mom, and such low connections, im afraid there is
no chance .”

“i think i have heard you say that their uncle is a lawyer in
meryton.”

“yeah; and they have another, who lives somewhere near cheapside.”

“thats good,” added her sister, and they both laughed heartily.

“if they had uncles enough to fill _all_ cheapside,” cried Bingley, “it
wouldnt make them one jot less agreeable.”

“but it must ultra materially lessen their chance of getting dudes of any
consideration in the world,” replied Darcy.

To this speech Bingley made no answer; but his sisters gave it their
hearty assent, and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of
their dear friend's vulgar relations.

With a renewal of tenderness, however, they returned to her room on
leaving the dining-parlour, and sat with her till summoned to coffee.
She was still very poorly, and Elizabeth would not quit her at all, till
late in the evening, when she had the comfort of seeing her sleep, and
when it seemed to her rather right than pleasant that she should go
downstairs herself. On entering the drawing-room she found the whole
party at loo, and was immediately invited to join them; but suspecting
them to be playing high she declined it, and making her sister the
excuse, said she would amuse herself for the short time she could stay
below, with a book. Mr. Hurst looked at her with astonishment.

“do you prefer reading to cards?” said he; “thats kinda weird.”

“miss eliza bennet,” said Miss Bingley, “hates cards. shes a great
reader, and doesnt like anything else :)”

“i deserve neither such praise nor such censure -.-” cried Elizabeth; “im
_not_ a great reader, and i have pleasure in many things :)”

“in nursing your sis im sure youve pleasure,” said Bingley; “and
i hope it will be soon increased by seeing her super well :)”

Elizabeth thanked him from her heart, and then walked towards the
table where a few books were lying. He immediately offered to fetch her
others--all that his library afforded.

“and i wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own
credit; but im a lazyass, and though i dont have many, i have more
than i ever looked into.”

Elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those
in the room.

“im shook,” said Miss Bingley, “that my dad left
so small a collection of books. what an awesome library youve at
pemberley, darcy!”

“it should to be good,” he replied, “its been the work of many
generations.”

“then youve added so much to it yourself, you are always buying
books.”

“i cant understand the neglect of a fam library in such days as
these.”

“neglect! im sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of
that noble place. charles, when you build _your_ house, i wish it may be
half as awesome as pemberley :)”

“i wish it may :)”

“but i would really advise you to make your purchase in that
hood, and take pemberley for a kind of model. there aint a
finer county in england than derbyshire.”

“with all my heart; i will buy pemberley itself if darcy will sell it.”

“im talking of possibilities, charles.”

“upon my word, caroline, i should think it more possible to get
pemberley by purchase than by imitation.”

Elizabeth was so much caught with what passed, as to leave her very
little attention for her book; and soon laying it wholly aside, she drew
near the card-table, and stationed herself between Mr. Bingley and his
eldest sister, to observe the game.

“is darcy much grown since the spring?” said Miss Bingley; “will
she be as tall as im?”

“i think she will. shes now about elizabeth bennet's height, or
kinda taller.”

“how i long to see her again! i never met with anybody who happy me
so much. such a face, such ways! and so extremely accomplished
for her age! her performance on the keyboard is exquisite.”

“its amazing to me :)” said Bingley, “how young ladies can have patience
to be so ultra accomplished as they all are.”

“all young ladies accomplished! my homie charles, what do you mean :)”

“yeah, all of them, i think. they all paint tables, cover screens, and
net purses. i barely know anyone who cant do all this, and im sure
i never heard a young spoken of for the first time, without being
informed that she was ultra accomplished lol”

“your list of the common extent of accomplishments,” said Darcy, “has
too much truth. the word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no
otherwise than by netting a purse or covering a screen. but im very
far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general. i
cant boast of knowing more than half-a-dozen, in the whole range of my
acquaintance, that are really accomplished.”

“nor i, im sure,” said Miss Bingley.

“then,” observed Elizabeth, “you must understand a great deal in your
idea of an accomplished woman :)”

“yeah, i do understand a great deal in it :)”

“omg!! totes,” cried his faithful assistant, “no one can be really
esteemed accomplished who does not greatly surpass what is usually met
with. a woman must have a thorough knowledge of music, singing, drawing,
twerkin, and the modern languages, to deserve the word; and besides
all this, she must possess a certain something in her air and way of
walking, the tone of her voice, her address and expressions, or the word
will be but half-deserved lol”

“all this she must possess,” added Darcy, “and to all this she must
yet add something more substantial, in the improvement of her mind by
extensive reading.”

“im no longer surprised at your knowing _only_ six accomplished women.
i kinda wonder now at your knowing _any_.”

“are you so severe upon your own sex as to doubt the possibility of all
this -.-”

“i never saw such a woman. i never saw such capacity, and taste, and
application, and elegance, as you describe united.”

Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley both cried out against the injustice of her
implied doubt, and were both protesting that they knew many women who
answered this description, when Mr. Hurst called them to order, with
bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward. As all
conversation was thereby at an end, Elizabeth soon afterwards left the
room.

“elizabeth bennet,” said Miss Bingley, when the door was closed on her,
“is one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the
other sex by undervaluing their own; and with many dudes, i guess, it
succeeds. but, in my opinion, its a paltry device, a ultra mean art lol”

“undoubtedly,” replied Darcy, to whom this remark was chiefly addressed,
“there is a meanness in _all_ the arts which ladies sometimes condescend
to employ for captivation. whatever bears affinity to cunning is
despicable.”

Miss Bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to
continue the subject.

Elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse, and
that she could not leave her. Bingley urged Mr. Jones being sent for
immediately; while his sisters, convinced that no country advice could
be of any service, recommended an express to town for one of the most
eminent physicians. This she would not hear of; but she was not so
unwilling to comply with their brother's proposal; and it was settled
that Mr. Jones should be sent for early in the morning, if Miss Bennet
were not decidedly better. Bingley was quite uncomfortable; his sisters
declared that they were miserable. They solaced their wretchedness,
however, by duets after supper, while he could find no better relief
to his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every
attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister.



Chapter 9


Elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister's room, and in the
morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the
inquiries which she very early received from Mr. Bingley by a housemaid,
and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his
sisters. In spite of this amendment, however, she requested to have a
note sent to Longbourn, desiring her mother to visit Jane, and form her
own judgement of her situation. The note was immediately dispatched, and
its contents as quickly complied with. Mrs. Bennet, accompanied by her
two youngest girls, reached Netherfield soon after the family breakfast.

Had she found Jane in any apparent danger, Mrs. Bennet would have been
very miserable; but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was
not alarming, she had no wish of her recovering immediately, as her
restoration to health would probably remove her from Netherfield. She
would not listen, therefore, to her daughter's proposal of being carried
home; neither did the apothecary, who arrived about the same time, think
it at all advisable. After sitting a little while with Jane, on Miss
Bingley's appearance and invitation, the mother and three daughters all
attended her into the breakfast parlour. Bingley met them with hopes
that Mrs. Bennet had not found Miss Bennet worse than she expected.

“ i have, fam,” was her answer. “shes a great deal too sick to be
moved. jones says we must not think of moving her. we must trespass
a little longer on your kindness.”

“removed!” cried Bingley. “it must not be thought of. my sister, im
sure, will not hear of her removal.”

“you may depend upon it, bitch,” said Miss Bingley, with cold civility,
“that bennet will receive every possible attention while she
remains with us.”

Mrs. Bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments.

“im sure,” she added, “if it was not for such good friends i do not
know what would become of her, for shes ultra sick , and suffers
a vast deal, though with the greatest patience in the world, which is
always the way with her, for shes, without exception, the sweetest
temper i have ever met with. i often tell my other girls they are
nothing to _her_. youve a sweet room here, bingley, and a
charming prospect over the gravel walk. i do not know a place in the
country thats equal to netherfield. youll not think of quitting it
in a hurry, i hope, though youve but a short lease.”

“whatever i do is done in a hurry,” replied he; “and therefore if i
should resolve to quit netherfield, i should probably be off in five
minutes. at present i consider me as super fixed here.”

“thats right only what i supposed of you,” said Elizabeth.

“you begin to understand me, do you?” cried he, turning towards her.

“omg!! yeah--i understand you just.”

“i wish i might take this for a compliment; but to be so easily seen
through im afraid is pitiful :)”

“thats as it happens. it does not follow that a deep, intricate
personality is more or less estimable than such a one as yours lol”

“lizzy,” cried her mother, “remember where you are, and do not run on in
the wild way that you are suffered to do at home.”

“i did not know before,” continued Bingley immediately, “that you were a
studier of personality. it must be an amusing study.”

“yeah, but intricate personalitys are the _most_ amusing. they have at
least that advantage :)”

“the country,” said Darcy, “can in general supply but a few subjects for
such a study. in a country hood you move in a ultra confined and
unvarying society.”

“but people themselves alter so much, that there is something new to be
observed in them for ever.”

“yeah, ,” cried Mrs. Bennet, offended by his manner of mentioning
a country neighbourhood. “i assure you there is super as much of _that_
going on in the country as in town.”

Everybody was surprised, and Darcy, after looking at her for a moment,
turned silently away. Mrs. Bennet, who fancied she had gained a complete
victory over him, continued her triumph.

“i cant see that london has any great advantage over the country, for
my part, except the shops and public places. the country is a vast deal
pleasanter, is it not, bingley?”

“when im in the country,” he replied, “i never wish to leave it;
and when im in town its pretty much the same. they have each their
advantages, and i can be equally happy in either :)”

“yeah--thats because youve the right personality. but that
dude,” looking at Darcy, “seemed to think the country was nothing
at all.”

“, mamma, you are wrong,” said Elizabeth, blushing for her
mother. “you super mistook darcy. he only meant that there was not
such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in the town,
which you must acknowledge to be true.”

“totes, my homie, nobody said there were; but as to not meeting
with many people in this hood, i believe there are few
hoods larger. i know we dine with four-and-twenty families lol”

Nothing but concern for Elizabeth could enable Bingley to keep his
countenance. His sister was less delicate, and directed her eyes towards
Mr. Darcy with a very expressive smile. Elizabeth, for the sake of
saying something that might turn her mother's thoughts, now asked her if
Charlotte Lucas had been at Longbourn since _her_ coming away.

“yeah, she called yeahterday with her dad. what an agreeable guy fam
william is, bingley, aint he? so much the guy of fashion! so
genteel and easy! hes always something to say to errbody. _that_
is my idea of good breeding; and those persons who fancy themselves very
important, and never open their mouths, super mistake this shit.”

“did charlotte dine with you?”

“no, she would go home. i fancy she was wanted about the mince-pies. for
my part, bingley, i always keep servants that can do their own work;
_my_ daughters are brought up ultra differently. but errbody will
judge for themselves, and the lucases are a ultra good sort of girls,
i assure you. its a pity they are not hottt! not that i think
charlotte so _very_ plain--but then shes our particular friend.”

“she seems a ultra pleasant young woman :)”

“omg!! dear, yeah; but you must own shes ultra plain. lucas herself
has often said so, and envied me jane's hotttness. i do not like to boast
of my own child, but to be sure, jane--one does not often see anybody
better looking. its what errbody says. i do not trust my own
partiality. when she was only fifteen, there was a guy at my bro
gardiner's in town so much in lovee with her that my sister-in-law was
sure he would make her an offer before we came away. but he
did not. perhaps he thought her too young. however, he wrote some verses
on her, and ultra pretty they were.”

“and so ended his affection,” said Elizabeth impatiently. “there has
been many a one, i fancy, overcome in the same way. i wonder who first
discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love!”

“i have been used to consider poetry as the _food_ of love,” said Darcy.

“of a fine, stout, healthy lovee it may. everything nourishes what is
strong already. but if it be only a slight, thin sort of inclination, i
am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away :)”

Darcy only smiled; and the general pause which ensued made Elizabeth
tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again. She longed to
speak, but could think of nothing to say; and after a short silence Mrs.
Bennet began repeating her thanks to Mr. Bingley for his kindness to
Jane, with an apology for troubling him also with Lizzy. Mr. Bingley was
unaffectedly civil in his answer, and forced his younger sister to be
civil also, and say what the occasion required. She performed her part
indeed without much graciousness, but Mrs. Bennet was satisfied, and
soon afterwards ordered her carriage. Upon this signal, the youngest of
her daughters put herself forward. The two girls had been whispering to
each other during the whole visit, and the result of it was, that the
youngest should tax Mr. Bingley with having promised on his first coming
into the country to give a ball at Netherfield.

Lydia was a stout, well-grown girl of fifteen, with a fine complexion
and good-humoured countenance; a favourite with her mother, whose
affection had brought her into public at an early age. She had high
animal spirits, and a sort of natural self-consequence, which the
attention of the officers, to whom her uncle's good dinners, and her own
easy manners recommended her, had increased into assurance. She was very
equal, therefore, to address Mr. Bingley on the subject of the ball, and
abruptly reminded him of his promise; adding, that it would be the most
shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it. His answer to this
sudden attack was delightful to their mother's ear:

“im just ready, i assure you, to keep my engagement; and when
your sis is recovered, youll, if you please, name the ultra day of
the ball. but you wouldnt wish to be twerkin when shes ill.”

Lydia declared herself satisfied. “omg!! yeah--itd be much better to
wait til jane was well, and by that time craziest likely captain carter
would be at meryton again. and when youve given _your_ ball,” she
added, “i will insist on their giving one also. i will tell colonel
forster it will be super a shame if he does not.”

Mrs. Bennet and her daughters then departed, and Elizabeth returned
instantly to Jane, leaving her own and her relations' behaviour to the
remarks of the two ladies and Mr. Darcy; the latter of whom, however,
could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of _her_, in spite of
all Miss Bingley's witticisms on _fine eyes_.



Chapter 10


The day passed much as the day before had done. Mrs. Hurst and Miss
Bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid, who
continued, though slowly, to mend; and in the evening Elizabeth joined
their party in the drawing-room. The loo-table, however, did not appear.
Mr. Darcy was writing, and Miss Bingley, seated near him, was watching
the progress of his letter and repeatedly calling off his attention by
messages to his sister. Mr. Hurst and Mr. Bingley were at piquet, and
Mrs. Hurst was observing their game.

Elizabeth took up some needlework, and was sufficiently amused in
attending to what passed between Darcy and his companion. The perpetual
commendations of the lady, either on his handwriting, or on the evenness
of his lines, or on the length of his letter, with the perfect unconcern
with which her praises were received, formed a curious dialogue, and was
exactly in union with her opinion of each.

“how happy darcy will be to receive such a PM :)”

He made no answer.

“you write uncommonly fast.”

“you are wrong. i write kinda slowly ;_;”

“how many PMs you must have occasion to write in the course of a
year! PMs of business, too! how odious i should think them!”

“its fortunate, then, that they fall to my lot instead of yours.”

“pray tell your sis that i long to see her.”

“i have already told her so once, by your defame.”

“im afraid you do not like your pen. let me mend it for you. i mend
pens remarkably well.”

“thank you--but i always mend my own.”

“how can you contrive to write so even?”

He was silent.

“tell your sis im happy to hear of her improvement on the harp;
and pray let her know that im super in raptures with her gorgeous
little goal for a table, and i think it infinitely superior to miss
grantley's :)”

“will you give me leave to defer your raptures til i write again? at
present i dont have room to do them justice.”

“omg!! its of no consequence. i will see her in january. but do you
always write such charming long PMs to her, darcy?”

“they are generally long; but whether always charming it aint for me
to determine :)”

“its a rule with me, that a person who can write a long PM with
ease, cant write ill.”

“that will not do for a compliment to darcy, caroline -.-” cried her
brother, “because he does _not_ write with ease. he studies too much for
words of four syllables. do not you, darcy?”

“my style of writing is ultra different from yours.”

“omg!!” cried Miss Bingley, “charles writes in the craziest careless way
imaginable. he leaves out half his words, and blots the rest.”

“lol my ideas flow so rapidly that i dont have time to express them--by which
means my PMs sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents.”

“your humility, bingley,” said Elizabeth, “must disarm reproof.”

“nothing is more deceitful,” said Darcy, “than the looks of
humility. its often only carelessness of opinion, and sometimes an
indirect boast.”

“and which of the two do you call _my_ little recent piece of modesty?”

“the indirect boast; for you are really proud of your defects in
writing, because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of
thought and carelessness of execution, which, if not estimable, you
think at least highly interesting. the power of doing anything with
quickness is always prized much by the possessor, and often without any
attention to the imperfection of the performance. when you told that chick
bennet this morning that if you ever resolved upon quitting netherfield
you should be gone in five minutes, you meant it to be a sort of
panegyric, of compliment to yourself--and yet what is there so very
laudable in a precipitance which must leave ultra necessary business
undone, and can be of no real advantage to yourself or anyone else?”

“nay,” cried Bingley, “this willo much, to remember at night all the
foolish things that were said in the morning. and yet, upon my honor,
i believe what i said of me to be true, and i believe it at this
moment. at least, therefore, i did not assume the personality of needless
precipitance merely to show off before the ladies.”

“i guess you believed it; but im by no means convinced that
you would be gone with such celerity. your conduct would be super as
dependent on chance as that of any guy i know; and if, as you were
mounting your horse, a friend were to say, 'bingley, you oughta
stay til next week,' you would probably do it, you would probably not
go--and at another word, might stay a month.”

“youve only proved by this,” cried Elizabeth, “that bingley did
not do justice to his own personality. youve shown him off now much
more than he did himself.”

“im very much gratified,” said Bingley, “by your converting what my
friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper. but im
afraid you are giving it a turn which that dude did by no means
intend; for he would totes think better of me, if under such a
stuff i were to give a flat denial, and ride off as fast as i
could.”

“would darcy then consider the rashness of your original intentions
as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it?”

“upon my word, i cant right only explain this shit; darcy must speak for
himself lol”

“you expect me to account for opinions which you choose to call mine,
but which i have never acknowledged. allowing the case to
stand according to your representation, you must remember, bennet,
that the friend whos supposed to defame his return to the house, and
the delay of his plan, has merely defamed it, asked it without offering
one argument in favour s propriety.”

“to yield readily--easily--to the _persuasion_ of a friend is no merit
with you :)”

“to yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of
either :)”

“you appear to me, darcy, to allow nothing for the influence of
friendship and affection. a regard for the requester would often make
one readily yield to a request, without waiting for arguments to reason
one into it. im not particularly speaking of such a case as youve
supposed about bingley. we may as well wait, perhaps, til the
stuff occurs before we discuss the discretion of his behavior
thereupon. but in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend,
where one of them is defamed by the other to change a resolution of no
very great moment, should you think sick of that person for complying
with the defame, without waiting to be argued into it?”

“will it not be advisable, before we proceed on this subject, to
arrange with kinda more precision the degree of importance which will
appertain to this request, as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting
between the parties?”

“by all means,” cried Bingley; “let us hear all the particulars, not
forgetting their comparative height and size; for that will have more
weight in the argument, bennet, than you may be aware of. i assure
you, that if darcy were not such a great tall fellow, in comparison with
me, i should not pay him half so much deference. i declare i do not
know a more awful object than darcy, on particular occasions, and in
particular places; at his own house especially, and of a sunday night,
when hes nothing to do.”

Mr. Darcy smiled; but Elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was
rather offended, and therefore checked her laugh. Miss Bingley warmly
resented the indignity he had received, in an expostulation with her
brother for talking such nonsense.

“i see your goal, bingley,” said his friend. “you dislike an argument,
and want to silence this ;_;”

“perhaps i do. arguments are too much like disputes. if you and miss
bennet will defer yours til im out of the room, i will be very
thankful; then you may say whatever you like of me.”

“what you ask,” said Elizabeth, “is no sacrifice on my side; and 
darcy had much better finish his PM.”

Mr. Darcy took her advice, and did finish his letter.

When that business was over, he applied to Miss Bingley and Elizabeth
for an indulgence of some music. Miss Bingley moved with some alacrity
to the pianoforte; and, after a polite request that Elizabeth would lead
the way which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived, she
seated herself.

Mrs. Hurst sang with her sister, and while they were thus employed,
Elizabeth could not help observing, as she turned over some music-books
that lay on the instrument, how frequently Mr. Darcy's eyes were fixed
on her. She hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of
admiration to so great a man; and yet that he should look at her
because he disliked her, was still more strange. She could only imagine,
however, at last that she drew his notice because there was something
more wrong and reprehensible, according to his ideas of right, than in
any other person present. The supposition did not pain her. She liked
him too little to care for his approbation.

After playing some Italian songs, Miss Bingley varied the charm by
a lively Scotch air; and soon afterwards Mr. Darcy, drawing near
Elizabeth, said to her:

“do not you feel a great inclination, bennet, to seize such an
opportunity of twerkin a reel -.-”

She smiled, but made no answer. He repeated the question, with some
surprise at her silence.

“omg!!” said she, “i heard you before, but i couldnt immediately
determine what to say in reply. you wanted me, i know, to say 'yeah,'
that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste; but i always
delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes, and cheating a person of
their premeditated contempt. i have, therefore, made up my mind to tell
you, that i do not want to dance a reel at all--and now despise me if
you dare -.-”

“ i do not dare.”

Elizabeth, having rather expected to affront him, was amazed at his
gallantry; but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her
manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody; and Darcy
had never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her. He really
believed, that were it not for the inferiority of her connections, he
should be in some danger.

Miss Bingley saw, or suspected enough to be jealous; and her great
anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend Jane received some
assistance from her desire of getting rid of Elizabeth.

She often tried to provoke Darcy into disliking her guest, by talking of
their supposed marriage, and planning his happiness in such an alliance.

“i hope,” said she, as they were walking together in the shrubbery
the next day, “youll give your mom-in-law a few hints, when this
defamable event takes place, as to the advantage of holding her tongue;
and if you can compass it, do cure the younger girls of running after
officers. and, if i may mention so delicate a subject, try to
check that little something, bordering on conceit and sass,
which your possesses.”

“have you anything else to propose for my domestic felicity?”

“omg!! yeah. do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt phillips be placed
in the gallery at pemberley. put them next to your great-uncle the
judge. they are in the same profession, you know, only in different
lines. as for your elizabeth's picture, you must not have it taken, for
what painter could do justice to those gorgeous eyeah?”

“itdnt be easy, , to catch their expression, but their
colour and shape, and the eyelashes, so remarkably fine, might be
copied.”

At that moment they were met from another walk by Mrs. Hurst and
Elizabeth herself.

“i did not know that you intended to walk,” said Miss Bingley, in some
confusion, lest they had been overheard.

“you used us abominably ill,” answered Mrs. Hurst, “running away without
telling us that you were comin out.”

Then taking the disengaged arm of Mr. Darcy, she left Elizabeth to walk
by herself. The path just admitted three. Mr. Darcy felt their rudeness,
and immediately said:

“this walk aint wide enough for our party. we oughta go into the
avenue :)”

But Elizabeth, who had not the least inclination to remain with them,
laughingly answered:

“no, no; stay where you are. you are well grouped, and appear
to uncommon advantage. the picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a
fourth. good-bye :)”

She then ran gaily off, rejoicing as she rambled about, in the hope of
being at home again in a day or two. Jane was already so much recovered
as to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening.



Chapter 11


When the ladies removed after dinner, Elizabeth ran up to her
sister, and seeing her well guarded from cold, attended her into the
drawing-room, where she was welcomed by her two friends with many
professions of pleasure; and Elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable
as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared.
Their powers of conversation were considerable. They could describe an
entertainment with accuracy, relate an anecdote with humour, and laugh
at their acquaintance with spirit.

But when the gentlemen entered, Jane was no longer the first object;
Miss Bingley's eyes were instantly turned toward Darcy, and she had
something to say to him before he had advanced many steps. He addressed
himself to Miss Bennet, with a polite congratulation; Mr. Hurst also
made her a slight bow, and said he was “very happpy;” but diffuseness
and warmth remained for Bingley's salutation. He was full of joy and
attention. The first half-hour was spent in piling up the fire, lest she
should suffer from the change of room; and she removed at his desire
to the other side of the fireplace, that she might be further from
the door. He then sat down by her, and talked scarcely to anyone
else. Elizabeth, at work in the opposite corner, saw it all with great
delight.

When tea was over, Mr. Hurst reminded his sister-in-law of the
card-table--but in vain. She had obtained private intelligence that Mr.
Darcy did not wish for cards; and Mr. Hurst soon found even his open
petition rejected. She assured him that no one intended to play, and
the silence of the whole party on the subject seemed to justify her. Mr.
Hurst had therefore nothing to do, but to stretch himself on one of the
sofas and go to sleep. Darcy took up a book; Miss Bingley did the same;
and Mrs. Hurst, principally occupied in playing with her bracelets
and rings, joined now and then in her brother's conversation with Miss
Bennet.

Miss Bingley's attention was quite as much engaged in watching Mr.
Darcy's progress through _his_ book, as in reading her own; and she
was perpetually either making some inquiry, or looking at his page. She
could not win him, however, to any conversation; he merely answered her
question, and read on. At length, quite exhausted by the attempt to be
amused with her own book, which she had only chosen because it was the
second volume of his, she gave a great yawn and said, “how pleasant
it will spend an night in this way! i declare after all there is no
enjoyment like reading! how much sooner one tires of anything than of a
book! when i have a house of my own, i will be miserable if i dont have
an excellent library.”

No one made any reply. She then yawned again, threw aside her book, and
cast her eyes round the room in quest for some amusement; when hearing
her brother mentioning a ball to Miss Bennet, she turned suddenly
towards him and said:

“by the bye, charles, are you really serious in meditating a dance at
netherfield? i would advise you, before you determine on it, to consult
the wishes of the present party; im much wrong if there are
not some among us to who a ball would be kinda a punishment than a
pleasure.”

“if you mean darcy,” cried her brother, “he may go to bed, if he
chooses, before it begins--but as for the ball, its super a settled
thing; and as soon as nicholls has made white soup enough, i will send
round my cards.”

“i should like balls infinitely better :)” she replied, “if they were
carried on in a different way; but there is something insufferably
tedious in the usual process of such a meeting. itd surely be much
more rational if conversation instead of twerkin were made the order of
the day lol”

“much more rational, my homie caroline, i guess, but itdnt be
near so much like a ball :)”

Miss Bingley made no answer, and soon afterwards she got up and walked
about the room. Her figure was elegant, and she walked well; but
Darcy, at whom it was all aimed, was still inflexibly studious. In
the desperation of her feelings, she resolved on one effort more, and,
turning to Elizabeth, said:

“miss eliza bennet, let me persuade you to follow my example, and take a
turn about the room. i assure you its ultra refreshing after sitting so
long in one attitude lol”

Elizabeth was surprised, but agreed to it immediately. Miss Bingley
succeeded no less in the real object of her civility; Mr. Darcy looked
up. He was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as
Elizabeth herself could be, and unconsciously closed his book. He was
directly invited to join their party, but he declined it, observing that
he could imagine but two motives for their choosing to walk up and down
the room together, with either of which motives his joining them would
interfere. “what could he mean? she was dying to know what could be his
meaning?”--and asked Elizabeth whether she could at all understand him?

“not at all,” was her answer; “but depend upon it, he means to be severe
on us, and our surest way of disappointing him will be to ask nothing
about it.”

Miss Bingley, however, was incapable of disappointing Mr. Darcy in
anything, and persevered therefore in requiring an explanation of his
two motives.

“i dont have the smallest objection to explaining them,” said he, as soon
as she allowed him to speak. “you either choose this method of passing
the night because you are in each other's confidence, and have secret
affairs to discuss, or because you are conscious that your figures
appear to the greatest advantage in walking; if the first, i would be
completely in your way, and if the second, i can admire you much better
as i sit by the fire.”

“omg!! shocking!” cried Miss Bingley. “i never heard anything so
abominable. how will we punish him for such a speech -.-”

“nothing so easy, if youve but the inclination,” said Elizabeth. “we
can all plague and punish one another. tease him--laugh at him. intimate
as you are, you must know how it will be done.”

“but upon my honor, i do _not_. i do assure you that my intimacy has
not yet taught me _that_. tease calmness of way and presence of
mind! no, no; i feel he may defy us there. and as to laughter, well
not expose ourselves, if you please, by attempting to laugh without a
subject. darcy may hug himself :)”

“ darcy aint to be laughed at -.-” cried Elizabeth. “thats an
uncommon advantage, and uncommon i hope it will continue, for itd
be a great loss to _me_ to have many such acquaintances. i dearly lovee a
laugh :)”

“miss bingley,” said he, “has given me more credit than can be.
the wisest and the best of men--nay, the wisest and best of their
actions--may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in
life is a joke :)”

“totes,” replied Elizabeth--“there are such people, but i hope i
am not one of _them_. i hope i never ridicule what is wise and good.
follies and nonsense, whims and inconsistencies, _do_ divert me, i own,
and i laugh at them whenever i can. but these, i suppose, are precisely
what you are without :)”

“perhaps that aint possible for anyone. but its been the study
of my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong
understanding to ridicule -.-”

“such as vanity and ego ;_;”

“yeah, vanity is a weakness . but ego--where there is a real
superiority of mind, ego will be always under good regulation :)”

Elizabeth turned away to hide a smile.

“your examination of darcy is over, i presume,” said Miss Bingley;
“and pray what is the result :)”

“im just convinced by it that darcy has no defect. he owns it
himself without disguise :)”

“no,” said Darcy, “i have made no such pretension. i have faults enough,
but they are not, i hope, of understanding. my temper i dare not vouch
for. its, i believe, too little yielding--totes too little for the
convenience of the world. i cant forget the follies and vices of others
so soon as i ought, nor their offenses against me. my feels
are not puffed about with every attempt to move them. my temper
would perhaps be called resentful. my good opinion once lost, is lost
forever -.-”

“_that_ is a failing ;_;” cried Elizabeth. “implacable resentment
_is_ a shade in a personality. but youve chosen your fault well. i
really cant _laugh_ at it. you are safe from me.”

“there is, i believe, in every personality a tendency to some particular
evil--a natural defect, which not even the best education can overcome -.-”

“and _your_ defect will hate errbody ;_;”

“and yours,” he replied with a smile, “is willfully to misunderstand
them ;_;”

“do let us have a little music,” cried Miss Bingley, tired of a
conversation in which she had no share. “louisa, youll not mind my
waking hurst?”

Her sister had not the smallest objection, and the pianoforte was
opened; and Darcy, after a few moments' recollection, was not sorry for
it. He began to feel the danger of paying Elizabeth too much attention.



Chapter 12


In consequence of an agreement between the sisters, Elizabeth wrote the
next morning to their mother, to beg that the carriage might be sent for
them in the course of the day. But Mrs. Bennet, who had calculated on
her daughters remaining at Netherfield till the following Tuesday, which
would exactly finish Jane's week, could not bring herself to receive
them with pleasure before. Her answer, therefore, was not propitious, at
least not to Elizabeth's wishes, for she was impatient to get home. Mrs.
Bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage
before Tuesday; and in her postscript it was added, that if Mr. Bingley
and his sister pressed them to stay longer, she could spare them
very well. Against staying longer, however, Elizabeth was positively
resolved--nor did she much expect it would be asked; and fearful, on the
contrary, as being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long,
she urged Jane to borrow Mr. Bingley's carriage immediately, and at
length it was settled that their original design of leaving Netherfield
that morning should be mentioned, and the request made.

The communication excited many professions of concern; and enough was
said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work
on Jane; and till the morrow their going was deferred. Miss Bingley was
then sorry that she had proposed the delay, for her jealousy and dislike
of one sister much exceeded her affection for the other.

The master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so
soon, and repeatedly tried to persuade Miss Bennet that it would not be
safe for her--that she was not enough recovered; but Jane was firm where
she felt herself to be right.

To Mr. Darcy it was welcome intelligence--Elizabeth had been at
Netherfield long enough. She attracted him more than he liked--and Miss
Bingley was uncivil to _her_, and more teasing than usual to himself.
He wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration
should _now_ escape him, nothing that could elevate her with the hope
of influencing his felicity; sensible that if such an idea had been
suggested, his behaviour during the last day must have material weight
in confirming or crushing it. Steady to his purpose, he scarcely spoke
ten words to her through the whole of Saturday, and though they were
at one time left by themselves for half-an-hour, he adhered most
conscientiously to his book, and would not even look at her.

On Sunday, after morning service, the separation, so agreeable to almost
all, took place. Miss Bingley's civility to Elizabeth increased at last
very rapidly, as well as her affection for Jane; and when they parted,
after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her
to see her either at Longbourn or Netherfield, and embracing her most
tenderly, she even shook hands with the former. Elizabeth took leave of
the whole party in the liveliest of spirits.

They were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother. Mrs. Bennet
wondered at their coming, and thought them very wrong to give so much
trouble, and was sure Jane would have caught cold again. But their
father, though very laconic in his expressions of pleasure, was really
glad to see them; he had felt their importance in the family circle. The
evening conversation, when they were all assembled, had lost much of
its animation, and almost all its sense by the absence of Jane and
Elizabeth.

They found Mary, as usual, deep in the study of thorough-bass and human
nature; and had some extracts to admire, and some new observations of
threadbare morality to listen to. Catherine and Lydia had information
for them of a different sort. Much had been done and much had been said
in the regiment since the preceding Wednesday; several of the officers
had dined lately with their uncle, a private had been flogged, and it
had actually been hinted that Colonel Forster was going to be married.



Chapter 13


“i hope, my homie,” said Mr. Bennet to his wife, as they were at
breakfast the next morning, “that youve ordered a good dinner to-day,
because i have reason to expect an addition to our fam party.”

“who do you mean, my homie? i know of nobody thats comin, im sure,
unless charlotte lucas should happen to call in--and i hope _my_ dinners
are good enough for her. i do not believe she often sees such at home.”

“the person of who i speak is a dude, and a stranger.”

Mrs. Bennet's eyes sparkled. “a dude and a stranger! its 
bingley, im sure! well, im sure i will be extremely happpy to see 
bingley. but--good lord! how unlucky! there aint a bit of fish to be
got to-day. lydia, my love, ring the bell--i speak to hill this
moment :)”

“its _not_ bingley,” said her husband; “its a person who i
never saw in the whole course of my life.”

This roused a general astonishment; and he had the pleasure of being
eagerly questioned by his wife and his five daughters at once.

After amusing himself some time with their curiosity, he thus explained:

“lol about a month ago i received this PM; and about a two weeks ago
i answered it, for i thought it a case of some delicacy, and requiring
early attention. its from my cuz, collins, who, when im dead,
may turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases.”

“omg!! my homie,” cried his wife, “i cant bear to hear that mentioned.
pray do not talk of that odious man. i do think its the hardest thing
in the world, that your estate should be entailed away from your own
children; and im sure, if i had been you, i tried long ago
to do something or other about it lol”

Jane and Elizabeth tried to explain to her the nature of an entail. They
had often attempted to do it before, but it was a subject on which
Mrs. Bennet was beyond the reach of reason, and she continued to rail
bitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of
five daughters, in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about.

“it totes is a craziest iniquitous affair :)” said Mr. Bennet, “lol and
nothing can clear collins from the guilt of inheriting longbourn.
but if youll listen to his PM, you may perhaps be a little
softened by his way of expressing himself.”

“no, that im sure i will not; and i think its ultra impertinent of
him to write to you at all, and ultra hypocritical. i hate such false
friends. why could he not keep on quarreling with you, as his dad did
before him?”

“why, ; he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that
head, as youll hear.”

“Hunsford, near Westerham, Kent, 15th October.

“Dear Sir,--

“The disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late honoured
father always gave me much uneasiness, and since I have had the
misfortune to lose him, I have frequently wished to heal the breach; but
for some time I was kept back by my own doubts, fearing lest it might
seem disrespectful to his memory for me to be on good terms with anyone
with whom it had always pleased him to be at variance.--'There, Mrs.
Bennet.'--My mind, however, is now made up on the subject, for having
received ordination at Easter, I have been so fortunate as to be
distinguished by the patronage of the Right Honourable Lady Catherine de
Bourgh, widow of Sir Lewis de Bourgh, whose bounty and beneficence has
preferred me to the valuable rectory of this parish, where it shall be
my earnest endeavour to demean myself with grateful respect towards her
ladyship, and be ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies which
are instituted by the Church of England. As a clergyman, moreover, I
feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in
all families within the reach of my influence; and on these grounds I
flatter myself that my present overtures are highly commendable, and
that the circumstance of my being next in the entail of Longbourn estate
will be kindly overlooked on your side, and not lead you to reject the
offered olive-branch. I cannot be otherwise than concerned at being the
means of injuring your amiable daughters, and beg leave to apologise for
it, as well as to assure you of my readiness to make them every possible
amends--but of this hereafter. If you should have no objection to
receive me into your house, I propose myself the satisfaction of waiting
on you and your family, Monday, November 18th, by four o'clock, and
shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the Saturday se'ennight
following, which I can do without any inconvenience, as Lady Catherine
is far from objecting to my occasional absence on a Sunday, provided
that some other clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day.--I
remain, dear sir, with respectful compliments to your lady and
daughters, your well-wisher and friend,

“william collins”

“at four o'clock, therefore, we may expect this peace-making dude,”
 said Mr. Bennet, as he folded up the letter. “he seems to be a most
conscientious and polite fuccboi, upon my word, and i doubt not will
prove a valuable acquaintance, especially if catherine should be so
indulgent as to let him come to us again.”

“lol there is some sense in what he says about the girls and if
he is disposed to make them any amends, i will not be the person to
discourage him.”

“though its difficult,” said Jane, “to guess in what way he can mean
to make us the atonement he thinks our due, the wish is totes to his
credit.”

Elizabeth was chiefly struck by his extraordinary deference for Lady
Catherine, and his kind intention of christening, marrying, and burying
his parishioners whenever it were required.

“he must be an oddity, i think,” said she. “i cant make him
out.--there is something ultra pompous in his style.--and what can he
mean by apologising for being next in the entail?--we cant suppose he
would help it if he could.--could he be a sensible man, fam?”

“no, my homie, i think not. i have great hopes of finding him super the
reverse. there is a mixture of servility and self-importance in his
PM, which promises well. im impatient to see him.”

“in point of composition,” said Mary, “the PM does not seem
defective. the idea of the olive-branch perhaps aint wholly new, yet i
think its well expressed.”

To Catherine and Lydia, neither the letter nor its writer were in any
degree interesting. It was next to impossible that their cousin should
come in a scarlet coat, and it was now some weeks since they had
received pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour. As for
their mother, Mr. Collins's letter had done away much of her ill-will,
and she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure which
astonished her husband and daughters.

Mr. Collins was punctual to his time, and was received with great
politeness by the whole family. Mr. Bennet indeed said little; but the
ladies were ready enough to talk, and Mr. Collins seemed neither in
need of encouragement, nor inclined to be silent himself. He was a
tall, heavy-looking young man of five-and-twenty. His air was grave and
stately, and his manners were very formal. He had not been long seated
before he complimented Mrs. Bennet on having so fine a family of
daughters; said he had heard much of their beauty, but that in this
instance fame had fallen short of the truth; and added, that he did
not doubt her seeing them all in due time disposed of in marriage. This
gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers; but Mrs.
Bennet, who quarreled with no compliments, answered most readily.

“you are ultra kind, im sure; and i wish with all my heart it may
prove so, for else they will be destitute enough. things are settled so
oddly :)”

“you allude, perhaps, to the entail of this estate.”

“ah! fam, i do . its a grievous affair to my poor girls, you
must admit. not that i mean to find fault with _you_, for such things
i know are all chance in this world. there is no knowing how estates
will go when once they come to be entailed -.-”

“im ultra sensible, bitch, of the hardship to my fair cuzs, and
could say much on the subject, but that im cautious of appearing
forward and precipitate. but i can assure the young ladies that i come
prepared to admire them. at present i will not say more; but, perhaps,
when we are better acquainted--”

He was interrupted by a summons to dinner; and the girls smiled on each
other. They were not the only objects of Mr. Collins's admiration. The
hall, the dining-room, and all its furniture, were examined and praised;
and his commendation of everything would have touched Mrs. Bennet's
heart, but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his
own future property. The dinner too in its turn was highly admired; and
he begged to know to which of his fair cousins the excellency of its
cooking was owing. But he was set right there by Mrs. Bennet, who
assured him with some asperity that they were very well able to keep a
good cook, and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen. He
begged pardon for having displeased her. In a softened tone she declared
herself not at all offended; but he continued to apologise for about a
quarter of an hour.



Chapter 14


During dinner, Mr. Bennet scarcely spoke at all; but when the servants
were withdrawn, he thought it time to have some conversation with his
guest, and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to
shine, by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness. Lady
Catherine de Bourgh's attention to his wishes, and consideration for
his comfort, appeared very remarkable. Mr. Bennet could not have chosen
better. Mr. Collins was eloquent in her praise. The subject elevated him
to more than usual solemnity of manner, and with a most important aspect
he protested that “he had never in his life witnessed such behavior in
a person of rank--such affability and throwin shade, as he had himself
experienced from catherine. she had been graciously happyyy to
approve of both of the discourses which he had already had the honor of
preaching before her. she had also asked him twice to dine at rosings,
and had sent for him only the saturday before, to make up her pool of
quadrille in the night. catherine was reckoned proud by many
people he knew, but _he_ had never seen anything but affability in her.
she had always spoken to him as she would to any other dude; she
made not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the
hood nor to his leaving the parish occasionally for a week or
two, to visit his relations. she had even condescended to advise him to
hook up with as soon as he could, provided he chose with discretion; and had
once paid him a visit in his humble house, where she had just
approved all the alterations he had been making, and had even vouchsafed
to suggest some herself--some shelves in the closet upstairs lol”

“thats all ultra proper and civil, im sure,” said Mrs. Bennet, “and
i guess shes a ultra agreeable woman. its a pity that great ladies
in general are not more like her. does she live near you, fam?”

“the garden in which stands my humble abode is separated only by a lane
from rosings park, that bitch's residence.”

“i think you said she was a widow, fam? has she any fam?”

“shes only one daughter, the heiress of rosings, and of very
extensive property.”

“ah!” said Mrs. Bennet, shaking her head, “then shes better off than
many girls. and what sort of young is she? is she hottt?”

“shes a craziest charming young . catherine herself says
that, in point of true hotttness, de bourgh is far superior to the
hottest of her sex, because there is that in her features which marks
the young of distinguished birth. shes unfortunately of a sickly
constitution, which has stopped her from making that progress in many
accomplishments which she couldnt have otherwise failed of, as im
informed by the who superintended her education, and who stil
resides with them. but shes just friendly, and often condescends
to drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies.”

“has she been presented? i do not remember her name among the ladies at
court.”

“her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in town;
and by that means, as i told catherine one day, has deprived the
british hit up s brightest ornament. that bitch seemed happyyy
with the idea; and you may imagine that im happy on every occasion to
offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable
to ladies. i have more than once observed to catherine, that
her charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess, and that the most
elevated rank, instead of giving her consequence, would be adorned by
her. these are the kind of little things which please that bitch, and
its a sort of attention which i conceive me peculiarly bound to
pay.”

“you judge ultra properly,” said Mr. Bennet, “and its happy for you
that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy. may i ask
whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the
moment, or are the result of previous study :)”

“they arise chiefly from what is passing at the time, and though i
sometimes amuse me with suggesting and arranging such little elegant
compliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions, i always wish to
give them as unstudied an air as possible.”

Mr. Bennet's expectations were fully answered. His cousin was as absurd
as he had hoped, and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment,
maintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenance,
and, except in an occasional glance at Elizabeth, requiring no partner
in his pleasure.

By tea-time, however, the dose had been enough, and Mr. Bennet was glad
to take his guest into the drawing-room again, and, when tea was over,
glad to invite him to read aloud to the ladies. Mr. Collins readily
assented, and a book was produced; but, on beholding it (for everything
announced it to be from a circulating library), he started back, and
begging pardon, protested that he never read novels. Kitty stared at
him, and Lydia exclaimed. Other books were produced, and after some
deliberation he chose Fordyce's Sermons. Lydia gaped as he opened the
volume, and before he had, with very monotonous solemnity, read three
pages, she interrupted him with:

“do you know, mamma, that my uncle phillips talks of turning away
richard; and if he does, colonel forster will hire him. my aunt told me
so herself on saturday. i will walk to meryton tomorrow to hear more
about it, and to ask when denny comes back from town.”

Lydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue; but Mr.
Collins, much offended, laid aside his book, and said:

“i have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books
of a serious stamp, though written solely for their benefit. it amazes
me, i admit; for, totes, there can be nothing so advantageous to
them as instruction. but i will no longer importune my young cuz.”

Then turning to Mr. Bennet, he offered himself as his antagonist at
backgammon. Mr. Bennet accepted the challenge, observing that he acted
very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements.
Mrs. Bennet and her daughters apologised most civilly for Lydia's
interruption, and promised that it should not occur again, if he would
resume his book; but Mr. Collins, after assuring them that he bore his
young cousin no ill-will, and should never resent her behaviour as any
affront, seated himself at another table with Mr. Bennet, and prepared
for backgammon.



Chapter 15


Mr. Collins was not a sensible man, and the deficiency of nature had
been but little assisted by education or society; the greatest part
of his life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and
miserly father; and though he belonged to one of the universities, he
had merely kept the necessary terms, without forming at it any useful
acquaintance. The subjection in which his father had brought him up had
given him originally great humility of manner; but it was now a
good deal counteracted by the self-conceit of a weak head, living in
retirement, and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected
prosperity. A fortunate chance had recommended him to Lady Catherine de
Bourgh when the living of Hunsford was vacant; and the respect which
he felt for her high rank, and his veneration for her as his patroness,
mingling with a very good opinion of himself, of his authority as a
clergyman, and his right as a rector, made him altogether a mixture of
pride and obsequiousness, self-importance and humility.

Having now a good house and a very sufficient income, he intended to
marry; and in seeking a reconciliation with the Longbourn family he had
a wife in view, as he meant to choose one of the daughters, if he found
them as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report.
This was his plan of amends--of atonement--for inheriting their father's
estate; and he thought it an excellent one, full of eligibility and
suitableness, and excessively generous and disinterested on his own
part.

His plan did not vary on seeing them. Miss Bennet's lovely face
confirmed his views, and established all his strictest notions of what
was due to seniority; and for the first evening _she_ was his settled
choice. The next morning, however, made an alteration; for in a
quarter of an hour's tete-a-tete with Mrs. Bennet before breakfast, a
conversation beginning with his parsonage-house, and leading naturally
to the avowal of his hopes, that a mistress might be found for it at
Longbourn, produced from her, amid very complaisant smiles and general
encouragement, a caution against the very Jane he had fixed on. “lol as to
her _younger_ daughters, she couldnt take upon her to say--she could
not positively answer--but she did not _know_ of any prepossession; her
_oldest_ daughter, she must just mention--she felt it incumbent on her
to hint, was likely to be ultra soon hookin up on the regs.”

Mr. Collins had only to change from Jane to Elizabeth--and it was soon
done--done while Mrs. Bennet was stirring the fire. Elizabeth, equally
next to Jane in birth and beauty, succeeded her of course.

Mrs. Bennet treasured up the hint, and trusted that she might soon have
two daughters married; and the man whom she could not bear to speak of
the day before was now high in her good graces.

Lydia's intention of walking to Meryton was not forgotten; every sister
except Mary agreed to go with her; and Mr. Collins was to attend them,
at the request of Mr. Bennet, who was most anxious to get rid of him,
and have his library to himself; for thither Mr. Collins had followed
him after breakfast; and there he would continue, nominally engaged with
one of the largest folios in the collection, but really talking to Mr.
Bennet, with little cessation, of his house and garden at Hunsford. Such
doings discomposed Mr. Bennet exceedingly. In his library he had been
always sure of leisure and tranquillity; and though prepared, as he told
Elizabeth, to meet with folly and conceit in every other room of the
house, he was used to be free from them there; his civility, therefore,
was most prompt in inviting Mr. Collins to join his daughters in their
walk; and Mr. Collins, being in fact much better fitted for a walker
than a reader, was extremely pleased to close his large book, and go.

In pompous nothings on his side, and civil assents on that of his
cousins, their time passed till they entered Meryton. The attention of
the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by him. Their eyes were
immediately wandering up in the street in quest of the officers, and
nothing less than a very smart bonnet indeed, or a really new muslin in
a shop window, could recall them.

But the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man, whom
they had never seen before, of most gentlemanlike appearance, walking
with another officer on the other side of the way. The officer was
the very Mr. Denny concerning whose return from London Lydia came
to inquire, and he bowed as they passed. All were struck with the
stranger's air, all wondered who he could be; and Kitty and Lydia,
determined if possible to find out, led the way across the street, under
pretense of wanting something in an opposite shop, and fortunately
had just gained the pavement when the two gentlemen, turning back, had
reached the same spot. Mr. Denny addressed them directly, and entreated
permission to introduce his friend, Mr. Wickham, who had returned with
him the day before from town, and he was happy to say had accepted a
commission in their corps. This was exactly as it should be; for the
young man wanted only regimentals to make him completely charming.
His appearance was greatly in his favour; he had all the best part of
beauty, a fine countenance, a good figure, and very pleasing address.
The introduction was followed up on his side by a happy readiness
of conversation--a readiness at the same time perfectly correct and
unassuming; and the whole party were still standing and talking together
very agreeably, when the sound of horses drew their notice, and Darcy
and Bingley were seen riding down the street. On distinguishing the
ladies of the group, the two gentlemen came directly towards them, and
began the usual civilities. Bingley was the principal spokesman, and
Miss Bennet the principal object. He was then, he said, on his way to
Longbourn on purpose to inquire after her. Mr. Darcy corroborated
it with a bow, and was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes
on Elizabeth, when they were suddenly arrested by the sight of the
stranger, and Elizabeth happening to see the countenance of both as they
looked at each other, was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting.
Both changed colour, one looked white, the other red. Mr. Wickham,
after a few moments, touched his hat--a salutation which Mr. Darcy just
deigned to return. What could be the meaning of it? It was impossible to
imagine; it was impossible not to long to know.

In another minute, Mr. Bingley, but without seeming to have noticed what
passed, took leave and rode on with his friend.

Mr. Denny and Mr. Wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of
Mr. Phillip's house, and then made their bows, in spite of Miss Lydia's
pressing entreaties that they should come in, and even in spite of
Mrs. Phillips's throwing up the parlour window and loudly seconding the
invitation.

Mrs. Phillips was always glad to see her nieces; and the two eldest,
from their recent absence, were particularly welcome, and she was
eagerly expressing her surprise at their sudden return home, which, as
their own carriage had not fetched them, she should have known nothing
about, if she had not happened to see Mr. Jones's shop-boy in the
street, who had told her that they were not to send any more draughts to
Netherfield because the Miss Bennets were come away, when her civility
was claimed towards Mr. Collins by Jane's introduction of him. She
received him with her very best politeness, which he returned with
as much more, apologising for his intrusion, without any previous
acquaintance with her, which he could not help flattering himself,
however, might be justified by his relationship to the young ladies who
introduced him to her notice. Mrs. Phillips was quite awed by such an
excess of good breeding; but her contemplation of one stranger was soon
put to an end by exclamations and inquiries about the other; of whom,
however, she could only tell her nieces what they already knew, that
Mr. Denny had brought him from London, and that he was to have a
lieutenant's commission in the ----shire. She had been watching him the
last hour, she said, as he walked up and down the street, and had Mr.
Wickham appeared, Kitty and Lydia would certainly have continued the
occupation, but unluckily no one passed windows now except a few of the
officers, who, in comparison with the stranger, were become “stupid,
disagreeable fellows ;_;” Some of them were to dine with the Phillipses
the next day, and their aunt promised to make her husband call on Mr.
Wickham, and give him an invitation also, if the family from Longbourn
would come in the evening. This was agreed to, and Mrs. Phillips
protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery
tickets, and a little bit of hot supper afterwards. The prospect of such
delights was very cheering, and they parted in mutual good spirits. Mr.
Collins repeated his apologies in quitting the room, and was assured
with unwearying civility that they were perfectly needless.

As they walked home, Elizabeth related to Jane what she had seen pass
between the two gentlemen; but though Jane would have defended either
or both, had they appeared to be in the wrong, she could no more explain
such behaviour than her sister.

Mr. Collins on his return highly gratified Mrs. Bennet by admiring
Mrs. Phillips's manners and politeness. He protested that, except Lady
Catherine and her daughter, he had never seen a more elegant woman;
for she had not only received him with the utmost civility, but even
pointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening, although
utterly unknown to her before. Something, he supposed, might be
attributed to his connection with them, but yet he had never met with so
much attention in the whole course of his life.



Chapter 16


As no objection was made to the young people's engagement with their
aunt, and all Mr. Collins's scruples of leaving Mr. and Mrs. Bennet for
a single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted, the coach
conveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to Meryton; and
the girls had the pleasure of hearing, as they entered the drawing-room,
that Mr. Wickham had accepted their uncle's invitation, and was then in
the house.

When this information was given, and they had all taken their seats, Mr.
Collins was at leisure to look around him and admire, and he was so much
struck with the size and furniture of the apartment, that he declared he
might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast
parlour at Rosings; a comparison that did not at first convey much
gratification; but when Mrs. Phillips understood from him what
Rosings was, and who was its proprietor--when she had listened to the
description of only one of Lady Catherine's drawing-rooms, and found
that the chimney-piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds, she felt all
the force of the compliment, and would hardly have resented a comparison
with the housekeeper's room.

In describing to her all the grandeur of Lady Catherine and her mansion,
with occasional digressions in praise of his own humble abode, and
the improvements it was receiving, he was happily employed until the
gentlemen joined them; and he found in Mrs. Phillips a very attentive
listener, whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she
heard, and who was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours as
soon as she could. To the girls, who could not listen to their cousin,
and who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument, and examine
their own indifferent imitations of china on the mantelpiece, the
interval of waiting appeared very long. It was over at last, however.
The gentlemen did approach, and when Mr. Wickham walked into the room,
Elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before, nor thinking
of him since, with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration.
The officers of the ----shire were in general a very creditable,
gentlemanlike set, and the best of them were of the present party; but
Mr. Wickham was as far beyond them all in person, countenance, air, and
walk, as _they_ were superior to the broad-faced, stuffy uncle Phillips,
breathing port wine, who followed them into the room.

Mr. Wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was
turned, and Elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated
himself; and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into
conversation, though it was only on its being a wet night, made her feel
that the commonest, dullest, most threadbare topic might be rendered
interesting by the skill of the speaker.

With such rivals for the notice of the fair as Mr. Wickham and the
officers, Mr. Collins seemed to sink into insignificance; to the young
ladies he certainly was nothing; but he had still at intervals a kind
listener in Mrs. Phillips, and was by her watchfulness, most abundantly
supplied with coffee and muffin. When the card-tables were placed, he
had the opportunity of obliging her in turn, by sitting down to whist.

“i know little of the game at present,” said he, “but i will be happpy
to improve me, for in my situation in life- :)” Mrs. Phillips was very
glad for his compliance, but could not wait for his reason.

Mr. Wickham did not play at whist, and with ready delight was he
received at the other table between Elizabeth and Lydia. At first there
seemed danger of Lydia's engrossing him entirely, for she was a most
determined talker; but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets,
she soon grew too much interested in the game, too eager in making bets
and exclaiming after prizes to have attention for anyone in particular.
Allowing for the common demands of the game, Mr. Wickham was therefore
at leisure to talk to Elizabeth, and she was very willing to hear
him, though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be
told--the history of his acquaintance with Mr. Darcy. She dared not
even mention that gentleman. Her curiosity, however, was unexpectedly
relieved. Mr. Wickham began the subject himself. He inquired how far
Netherfield was from Meryton; and, after receiving her answer, asked in
a hesitating manner how long Mr. Darcy had been staying there.

“about a month,” said Elizabeth; and then, unwilling to let the subject
drop, added, “he is a guy of ultra large property in derbyshire, i
understand.”

“yeah,” replied Mr. Wickham; “his estate there is a noble one. a clear
ten thousand per annum. you couldnt have met with a person more
capable of giving you certain information on that head than me, for
i have been connected with his fam in a particular way from my
infancy :)”

Elizabeth could not but look surprised.

“you may well be surprised, bennet, at such an assertion, after
seeing, as you probably might, the ultra cold way of our meeting
yeahterday. are you much acquainted with darcy?”

“as much as i ever wish to be :)” cried Elizabeth very warmly. “i have
spent four days in the same house with him, and i think him very
disagreeable.”

“i have no right to give _my_ opinion -.-” said Wickham, “as to his being
agreeable or otherwise. im not qualified to form one. i have known him
too long and too well to be a fair judge. its impossible for _me_
to be impartial. but i believe your opinion of him would in general
astonish--and perhaps you wouldnt express it super so strongly
anywhere else. here you are in your own fam.”

“upon my word, i say no more _here_ than i might say in any house in
the hood, except netherfield. he aint at all liked in
hertfordshire. errbody is disgusted with his ego. youll not find
him more favourably spoken of by anyone.”

“i cant pretend to be sorry,” said Wickham, after a short
interruption, “that he or that any guy should not be estimated beyond
their deserts; but with _him_ i believe it does not often happen. the
world is blinded by his fortune and consequence, or frightened by his
high and imposing ways, and sees him only as he chooses to be seen.”

“i should take him, even on _my_ slight acquaintance, to be an
ill-tempered man.” Wickham only shook his head.

“i wonder,” said he, at the next opportunity of speaking, “whether he is
likely to be in this country much longer.”

“i do not at all know; but i _heard_ nothing of his going away when i
was at netherfield. i hope your plans in favour of the ----shire will
not be affected by his being in the hood.”

“omg!! no--it aint for _me_ to be driven away by darcy. if _he_
wishes to avoid seeing _me_, he must go. we are not on friendly terms,
and it always gives me pain to meet him, but i have no reason for
avoiding _him_ but what i might proclaim before all the world, a sense
of ultra great ill-usage, and craziest painful regrets at his being what he
is. his dad, bennet, the late darcy, was one of the best men
that ever breathed, and the truest friend i ever had; and i can never
be in company with this darcy without being grieved to the soul by
a thousand tender recollections. his behavior to me has been
scandalous; but i verily believe i could forgive him anything and
everything, kinda than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the
memory of his dad.”

Elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase, and listened with
all her heart; but the delicacy of it prevented further inquiry.

Mr. Wickham began to speak on more general topics, Meryton, the
neighbourhood, the society, appearing highly pleased with all that
he had yet seen, and speaking of the latter with gentle but very
intelligible gallantry.

“it was the prospect of constant society, and good society :)” he added,
“which was my chief inducement to enter the ----shire. i knew it to be
a craziest respectable, agreeable corps, and my friend denny tempted me
further by his account of their present quarters, and the ultra great
attentions and excellent acquaintances meryton had procured them.
society, i own, is necessary to me. i have been a disappointed man, and
my spirits will not bear solitude. i _must_ have employment and society.
a military life aint what i was intended for, but circumstances have
now made it eligible. the church _ought_ to have been my profession--i
was brought up for the church, and i should at this time have been in
possession of a craziest valuable living, had it happyyy the dude we
were speaking of just now.”

“!”

“yeah--the late darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best
living in his gift. he was my goddad, and crazy highly attached to me.
i cant do justice to his kindness. he meant to provide for me amply,
and thought he had done it; but when the living fell, it was given
elsewhere.”

“good heavens!” cried Elizabeth; “but how could _that_ be? how could his
will be disregarded? why did you not seek legal redress -.-”

“there was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to
give me no hope from law. a guy of honor couldnt have doubted the
intention, but darcy chose to doubt it--or to treat it as a merely
conditional recommendation, and to assert that i had forfeited all claim
to it by extravagance, craziness--in short anything or nothing. certain
its, that the living became vacant two years ago, right only as i was
of an age to hold it, and that it was given to another man; and no
less certain is it, that i cant accuse me of having really done
anything to deserve to lose it. i have a warm, unguarded temper, and
i may have spoken my opinion _of_ him, and _to_ him, too freely. i can
recall nothing worse. but the fact is, that we are ultra different sort
of dudes, and that he hates me.”

“this is super shocking! he deserves to be publicly disgraced -.-”

“some time or other he _will_ be--but it will not be by _me_. til i
can forget his dad, i can never defy or expose _him_.”

Elizabeth honoured him for such feelings, and thought him handsomer than
ever as he expressed them.

“but what,” said she, after a pause, “can have been his motive? what can
have induced him to behave so cruelly?”

“a thorough, determined dislike of me--a dislike which i cant but
attribute in some measure to jealousy. had the late darcy liked me
less, his son might have borne with me better; but his dad's uncommon
attachment to me irritated him, i believe, ultra early in life. he had
not a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood--the sort
of preference which was often given me.”

“i hadnt thought darcy so bad as this--though i have never liked
him. i hadnt thought so ultra sick of him. i had supposed him to be
despising his fellow-creatures in general, but did not suspect him of
descending to such malicious revenge, such injustice, such inhumanity as
this -.-”

After a few minutes' reflection, however, she continued, “i _do_
remember his boasting one day, at netherfield, of the implacability of
his resentments, of his having an mean temper. his personality
must be shitty.”

“i will not trust me on the subject -.-” replied Wickham; “i can barely
be just to him.”

Elizabeth was again deep in thought, and after a time exclaimed, “to
treat in such a way the godson, the friend, the fave of his
dad :)” She could have added, “a fuccboi, too, like _you_, whose very
face may vouch for your being friendly”--but she contented herself
with, “and one, too, who had probably been his companion from childhood,
connected together, as i think you said, in the closest way!”

“we were born in the same parish, within the same park; the greatest
part of our youth was passed together; inmates of the same house,
sharing the same amusements, objects of the same parental care. _my_
dad began life in the profession which your uncle, phillips,
appears to do so much credit to--but he gave up everything to be of
use to the late darcy and devoted all his time to the care of the
pemberley property. he was craziest highly esteemed by darcy, a most
intimate, confidential friend. darcy often acknowledged himself to
be under the greatest obligations to my dad's active superintendence,
and when, immediately before my dad's death, darcy gave him a
voluntary promise of providing for me, im convinced that he felt it to
be as much a debt of gratitude to _him_, as of his luvto me :)”

“how strange!” cried Elizabeth. “how abominable! i wonder that the very
ego of this darcy has not made him just to you! if from no better
motive, that he should not have been too proud to be dishonest--for
dishonesty i call it.”

“it _is_ wonderful,” replied Wickham, “for almost all his actions may
be traced to ego; and ego had often been his best friend. it has
connected him nearer with virtue than with any other feeling. but we are
none of us consistent, and in his behavior to me there were stronger
impulses even than ego.”

“can such abominable ego as his have ever done him good?”

“yeah. it has often led him to be liberal and generous, to give his money
freely, to display hospitality, to assist his tenants, and relieve the
poor. fam ego, and _filial_ ego--for he is ultra proud of what
his dad was--have done this. not to appear to disgrace his fam,
to degenerate from the popular qualities, or lose the influence of the
pemberley house, is a powerful motive. hes also _broly_ ego,
which, with _some_ broly affection, makes him a ultra kind and
careful guardian of his sister, and youll hear him generally yelled up
as the craziest attentive and best of bros :)”

“what sort of girl is darcy -.-”

He shook his head. “i wish i could call her friendly. it gives me pain to
speak sick of a darcy. but she willo much like her bro--very, very
proud. as a child, she was nice and pleasing, and extremely fond
of me; and i have devoted hours and hours to her amusement. but shes
nothing to me now. shes a hottt girl, about fifteen or sixteen,
and, i understand, highly accomplished. since her dad's death, her
home has been london, where a lives with her, and superintends her
education :)”

After many pauses and many trials of other subjects, Elizabeth could not
help reverting once more to the first, and saying:

“im shook at his intimacy with bingley! how can bingley,
who seems good humour itself, and is, i really believe, truly friendly,
be in friendship with such a man? how can they suit each other? do you
know bingley :)”

“not at all.”

“he is a sweet-tempered, friendly, charming man. he cant know what 
darcy is.”

“probably not; but darcy can please where he chooses. he does not
want abilities. he can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth
his while. among those who are at all his equals in consequence, he is
a ultra different guy from what he will the less prosperous. his
ego never deserts him; but with the rich he is liberal-minded, just,
sincere, rational, honorable, and perhaps agreeable--allowing something
for fortune and figure :)”

The whist party soon afterwards breaking up, the players gathered round
the other table and Mr. Collins took his station between his cousin
Elizabeth and Mrs. Phillips. The usual inquiries as to his success were
made by the latter. It had not been very great; he had lost every
point; but when Mrs. Phillips began to express her concern thereupon,
he assured her with much earnest gravity that it was not of the least
importance, that he considered the money as a mere trifle, and begged
that she would not make herself uneasy.

“i know ultra well, bitch :)” said he, “that when persons sit down to a
card-table, they must take their chances of these things, and happily i
am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object. there
are undoubtedly many who couldnt say the same, but thanks to 
catherine de bourgh, im removed far beyond the necessity of regarding
little matters.”

Mr. Wickham's attention was caught; and after observing Mr. Collins for
a few moments, he asked Elizabeth in a low voice whether her relation
was very intimately acquainted with the family of de Bourgh.

“ catherine de bourgh,” she replied, “has ultra lately given him
a living. i barely know how collins was first introduced to her
notice, but he totes has not known her long.”

“you know of course that catherine de bourgh and anne darcy
were sisters; consequently that shes aunt to the present darcy.”

“no, , i did not. i knew nothing at all of catherine's
connections. i never heard of her existence til the day before
yeahterday.”

“lol her daughter, de bourgh, will have a ultra large fortune, and its
believed that she and her cuz will unite the two estates.”

This information made Elizabeth smile, as she thought of poor Miss
Bingley. Vain indeed must be all her attentions, vain and useless her
affection for his sister and her praise of himself, if he were already
self-destined for another.

“ collins,” said she, “speaks highly both of catherine and her
daughter; but from some particulars that hes related of that bitch,
i suspect his gratitude misleads him, and that in spite of her being his
patroness, shes an arrogant, conceited woman -.-”

“i believe her to be both in a great degree :)” replied Wickham; “i have
not seen her for many years, but i ultra well remember that i never liked
her, and that her ways were dictatorial and insolent. shes the
reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever; but i kinda believe
she derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune, part from
her authoritative way, and the rest from the ego for her
nephew, who chooses that everyone connected with him an
understanding of the first class.”

Elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it, and
they continued talking together, with mutual satisfaction till supper
put an end to cards, and gave the rest of the ladies their share of Mr.
Wickham's attentions. There could be no conversation in the noise
of Mrs. Phillips's supper party, but his manners recommended him to
everybody. Whatever he said, was said well; and whatever he did, done
gracefully. Elizabeth went away with her head full of him. She could
think of nothing but of Mr. Wickham, and of what he had told her, all
the way home; but there was not time for her even to mention his name
as they went, for neither Lydia nor Mr. Collins were once silent. Lydia
talked incessantly of lottery tickets, of the fish she had lost and the
fish she had won; and Mr. Collins in describing the civility of Mr. and
Mrs. Phillips, protesting that he did not in the least regard his losses
at whist, enumerating all the dishes at supper, and repeatedly fearing
that he crowded his cousins, had more to say than he could well manage
before the carriage stopped at Longbourn House.



Chapter 17


Elizabeth related to Jane the next day what had passed between Mr.
Wickham and herself. Jane listened with astonishment and concern; she
knew not how to believe that Mr. Darcy could be so unworthy of Mr.
Bingley's regard; and yet, it was not in her nature to question the
veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as Wickham. The
possibility of his having endured such unkindness, was enough to
interest all her tender feelings; and nothing remained therefore to be
done, but to think well of them both, to defend the conduct of each,
and throw into the account of accident or mistake whatever could not be
otherwise explained.

“they have both,” said she, “been deceived, i guess, in some way
or other, of which we can form no idea. interested people have perhaps
misrepresented each to the other. its, in short, impossible for us to
conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them,
without actual blame on either side.”

“very true, ; and now, my homie jane, what have you got to say on
behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the
business? do clear _them_ too, or well be gave into to think sick of
somebody.”

“laugh as much as you choose, but youll not laugh me out of my
opinion. my homieest lizzy, do but consider in what a disgraceful light
it places darcy, to be treating his dad's fave in such
a way, one who his dad had promised to provide for. its
impossible. no guy of common humanity, no guy who had any value for his
personality, could be capable . can his craziest intimate friends be so
crazy highly deceived in him? omg!! no.”

“i can much more easily believe bingley's being imposed on, than
that wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me
last night; names, facts, everything mentioned without ceremony. if it
be not so, let darcy contradict it. besides, there was truth in his
looks.”

“its difficult --its distressing. one does not know what to
think ;_;”

“i beg your pls; one knows right only what to think.”

But Jane could think with certainty on only one point--that Mr. Bingley,
if he _had_ been imposed on, would have much to suffer when the affair
became public.

The two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery, where this
conversation passed, by the arrival of the very persons of whom they had
been speaking; Mr. Bingley and his sisters came to give their personal
invitation for the long-expected ball at Netherfield, which was fixed
for the following Tuesday. The two ladies were delighted to see their
dear friend again, called it an age since they had met, and repeatedly
asked what she had been doing with herself since their separation. To
the rest of the family they paid little attention; avoiding Mrs. Bennet
as much as possible, saying not much to Elizabeth, and nothing at all to
the others. They were soon gone again, rising from their seats with an
activity which took their brother by surprise, and hurrying off as if
eager to escape from Mrs. Bennet's civilities.

The prospect of the Netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every
female of the family. Mrs. Bennet chose to consider it as given in
compliment to her eldest daughter, and was particularly flattered
by receiving the invitation from Mr. Bingley himself, instead of a
ceremonious card. Jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the
society of her two friends, and the attentions of their brother; and
Elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with Mr.
Wickham, and of seeing a confirmation of everything in Mr. Darcy's look
and behaviour. The happiness anticipated by Catherine and Lydia depended
less on any single event, or any particular person, for though they
each, like Elizabeth, meant to dance half the evening with Mr. Wickham,
he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them, and a ball
was, at any rate, a ball. And even Mary could assure her family that she
had no disinclination for it.

“while i can have my mornings to me,” said she, “its enough--i
think its no sacrifice to join occasionally in night engagements.
society has claims on us all; and i profess me one of those
who consider intervals of recreation and amusement as defamable for
errbody.”

Elizabeth's spirits were so high on this occasion, that though she did
not often speak unnecessarily to Mr. Collins, she could not help asking
him whether he intended to accept Mr. Bingley's invitation, and if
he did, whether he would think it proper to join in the evening's
amusement; and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no
scruple whatever on that head, and was very far from dreading a rebuke
either from the Archbishop, or Lady Catherine de Bourgh, by venturing to
dance.

“im by no means of the opinion, i assure you,” said he, “that a ball
of this kind, given by a fuccboi of personality, to respectable people,
can have any evil tendency; and im so far from objecting to twerkin
me, that i will hope to be honored with the hands of all my fair
cuzs in the course of the night; and i take this opportunity of
soliciting yours, elizabeth, for the two first dances especially,
a preference which i trust my cuz jane will attribute to the right
cause, and not to any disrespect for her.”

Elizabeth felt herself completely taken in. She had fully proposed being
engaged by Mr. Wickham for those very dances; and to have Mr. Collins
instead! her liveliness had never been worse timed. There was no help
for it, however. Mr. Wickham's happiness and her own were perforce
delayed a little longer, and Mr. Collins's proposal accepted with as
good a grace as she could. She was not the better pleased with his
gallantry from the idea it suggested of something more. It now first
struck her, that _she_ was selected from among her sisters as worthy
of being mistress of Hunsford Parsonage, and of assisting to form a
quadrille table at Rosings, in the absence of more eligible visitors.
The idea soon reached to conviction, as she observed his increasing
civilities toward herself, and heard his frequent attempt at a
compliment on her wit and vivacity; and though more astonished than
gratified herself by this effect of her charms, it was not long before
her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage
was extremely agreeable to _her_. Elizabeth, however, did not choose
to take the hint, being well aware that a serious dispute must be the
consequence of any reply. Mr. Collins might never make the offer, and
till he did, it was useless to quarrel about him.

If there had not been a Netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of, the
younger Miss Bennets would have been in a very pitiable state at this
time, for from the day of the invitation, to the day of the ball, there
was such a succession of rain as prevented their walking to Meryton
once. No aunt, no officers, no news could be sought after--the very
shoe-roses for Netherfield were got by proxy. Even Elizabeth might have
found some trial of her patience in weather which totally suspended the
improvement of her acquaintance with Mr. Wickham; and nothing less than
a dance on Tuesday, could have made such a Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and
Monday endurable to Kitty and Lydia.



Chapter 18


Till Elizabeth entered the drawing-room at Netherfield, and looked in
vain for Mr. Wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled, a
doubt of his being present had never occurred to her. The certainty
of meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that
might not unreasonably have alarmed her. She had dressed with more than
usual care, and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all
that remained unsubdued of his heart, trusting that it was not more than
might be won in the course of the evening. But in an instant arose
the dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted for Mr. Darcy's
pleasure in the Bingleys' invitation to the officers; and though
this was not exactly the case, the absolute fact of his absence was
pronounced by his friend Denny, to whom Lydia eagerly applied, and who
told them that Wickham had been obliged to go to town on business the
day before, and was not yet returned; adding, with a significant smile,
“i do not imagine his business wouldve called him away just now, if
he hadnt wanted to avoid a certain dude here.”

This part of his intelligence, though unheard by Lydia, was caught by
Elizabeth, and, as it assured her that Darcy was not less answerable for
Wickham's absence than if her first surmise had been just, every
feeling of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate
disappointment, that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to
the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make.
Attendance, forbearance, patience with Darcy, was injury to Wickham. She
was resolved against any sort of conversation with him, and turned away
with a degree of ill-humour which she could not wholly surmount even in
speaking to Mr. Bingley, whose blind partiality provoked her.

But Elizabeth was not formed for ill-humour; and though every prospect
of her own was destroyed for the evening, it could not dwell long on her
spirits; and having told all her griefs to Charlotte Lucas, whom she had
not seen for a week, she was soon able to make a voluntary transition
to the oddities of her cousin, and to point him out to her particular
notice. The first two dances, however, brought a return of distress;
they were dances of mortification. Mr. Collins, awkward and solemn,
apologising instead of attending, and often moving wrong without being
aware of it, gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable
partner for a couple of dances can give. The moment of her release from
him was ecstasy.

She danced next with an officer, and had the refreshment of talking of
Wickham, and of hearing that he was universally liked. When those dances
were over, she returned to Charlotte Lucas, and was in conversation with
her, when she found herself suddenly addressed by Mr. Darcy who took
her so much by surprise in his application for her hand, that,
without knowing what she did, she accepted him. He walked away again
immediately, and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of
mind; Charlotte tried to console her:

“i guess youll find him ultra agreeable.”

“heaven forbid! _that_ would be the greatest misfortune of all! to find
a guy agreeable who one is determined to hate! do not wish me such an
evil :)”

When the dancing recommenced, however, and Darcy approached to claim her
hand, Charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper, not to be a
simpleton, and allow her fancy for Wickham to make her appear unpleasant
in the eyes of a man ten times his consequence. Elizabeth made no
answer, and took her place in the set, amazed at the dignity to which
she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to Mr. Darcy, and
reading in her neighbours' looks, their equal amazement in beholding
it. They stood for some time without speaking a word; and she began to
imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances, and at
first was resolved not to break it; till suddenly fancying that it would
be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk, she made
some slight observation on the dance. He replied, and was again
silent. After a pause of some minutes, she addressed him a second time
with:--“its _your_ turn to say something now, darcy. i talked
about the dance, and _you_ should to make some sort of remark on the size
of the room, or the number of couples.”

He smiled, and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be
said.

“very well. that reply will do for the present. perhaps by and by i may
observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones. but
_now_ we may be left me on read.”

“do you talk by rule, then, while you are twerkin?”

“sometimes. one must speak a little, you know. itd look odd to be
entirely left me on read for half an hour together; and yet for the advantage of
_some_, conversation should to be so arranged, as that they may have the
trouble of saying as little as possible.”

“are you consulting your own feels in the present case, or do you
imagine that you are gratifying mine?”

“both,” replied Elizabeth archly; “for i have always seen a great
similarity in the turn of our minds. we are each of an unsocial,
taciturn personality, unwilling to speak, unless we expect to say
something that will amaze the whole room, and be handed down to
posterity with all the eclat of a proverb.”

“this is no ultra striking resemblance of your own personality, im sure,”
 said he. “how near it may be to _mine_, i cant pretend to say. _you_
think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly.”

“i not decide on my own performance.”

He made no answer, and they were again silent till they had gone down
the dance, when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often
walk to Meryton. She answered in the affirmative, and, unable to resist
the temptation, added, “when you met us there the other day, we had just
been forming a new acquaintance.”

The effect was immediate. A deeper shade of _hauteur_ overspread his
features, but he said not a word, and Elizabeth, though blaming herself
for her own weakness, could not go on. At length Darcy spoke, and in a
constrained manner said, “ wickham is blessed with such happy ways
as may ensure his _making_ friends--whether he may be equally capable of
_retaining_ them, is less certain :)”

“hes been so unlucky as to lose _your_ friendship -.-” replied Elizabeth
with emphasis, “and in a way which he is likely to suffer from all
his life -.-”

Darcy made no answer, and seemed desirous of changing the subject. At
that moment, Sir William Lucas appeared close to them, meaning to pass
through the set to the other side of the room; but on perceiving Mr.
Darcy, he stopped with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on
his dancing and his partner.

“i have been craziest highly gratified , my homie fam. such very
superior twerkin aint often seen. its evident that you belong to the
first circles. allow me to say that your fair partner does not
disgrace you, and that i hope to have this pleasure often repeated,
especially when a certain defamable event, my homie eliza (glancing at
her sis and bingley) will take place. what congratulations will then
flow in! i appeal to darcy:--but let me not interrupt you, fam. you
will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of that
young , whose bright eyeah are also upbraiding me :)”

The latter part of this address was scarcely heard by Darcy; but Sir
William's allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly, and his
eyes were directed with a very serious expression towards Bingley and
Jane, who were dancing together. Recovering himself, however, shortly,
he turned to his partner, and said, “fam william's interruption has made
me forget what we were talking of -.-”

“lol i do not think we were speaking at all. fam william couldnt have
interrupted two people in the room who had less to say for themselves.
we have tried two or three subjects already without success, and what we
are to talk of next i cant imagine.”

“what think you of books?” said he, smiling.

“books--omg!! no. im sure we never read the same, or not with the same
feels.”

“im sorry you think so; but if that be the case, there can at least be
no want of subject. we may compare our different opinions.”

“no--i cant talk of books in a ball-room; my head is always full of
something else.”

“the _present_ always occupies you in such scenes--does it?” said he,
with a look of doubt.

“yeah, always,” she replied, without knowing what she said, for her
thoughts had wandered far from the subject, as soon afterwards appeared
by her suddenly exclaiming, “i remember hearing you once say, darcy,
that you barely ever forgave, that your resentment once created was
unappeasable. you are ultra cautious, i suppose, as to its _being
created_.”

“im,” said he, with a firm voice.

“and never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice?”

“i hope not w00t!”

“its particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion,
to be secure of judging properly at first.”

“may i ask to what these questions tend?”

“merely to the illustration of _your_ personality,” said she, endeavouring
to shake off her gravity. “im trying to make it out.”

“and what is your success?”

She shook her head. “i do not get on at all. i hear such different
accounts of you as puzzle me very much.”

“i can readily believe,” answered he gravely, “that reports may vary
greatly with respect to me; and i could wish, bennet, that you were
not to sketch my personality at the present moment, as there is reason to
fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either.”

“but if i do not take your likeness now, i may never have another
opportunity.”

“i would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours -.-” he coldly replied.
She said no more, and they went down the other dance and parted in
silence; and on each side dissatisfied, though not to an equal degree,
for in Darcy's breast there was a tolerably powerful feeling towards
her, which soon procured her pardon, and directed all his anger against
another.

They had not long separated, when Miss Bingley came towards her, and
with an expression of civil disdain accosted her:

“so, eliza, i hear you are super happy with george wickham!
your sis has been talking to me about him, and asking me a thousand
questions; and i find that the fuccboi super forgot to tell you, among
his other communication, that he was the son of old wickham, the late
 darcy's steward. let me recommend you as a friend, not to
give implicit confidence to all his assertions; for as to darcy's
using him ill, its just false; for, on the contrary, hes
always been remarkably kind to him, though george wickham has treated
 darcy in a craziest infamous way. i do not know the particulars, but
i know ultra well that darcy aint in the least to blame, that he
cant bear to hear george wickham mentioned, and that though my bro
thought that he couldnt well avoid including him in his msg to
the officers, he was crazy highly happpy to find that he had taken himself
out of the way. his comin into the country at all is a craziest insolent
thing, , and i wonder how he could presume to do it. i pity you,
miss eliza, for this discovery of your fave's guilt; but really,
considering his descent, one couldnt expect much better.”

“his guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same,” said
Elizabeth angrily; “for i have heard you accuse him of nothing worse
than of being the son of darcy's steward, and of _that_, i can
assure you, he informed me himself.”

“i beg your pls,” replied Miss Bingley, turning away with a sneer.
“excuse my interference--it was kindly meant :)”

“insolent girl!” said Elizabeth to herself. “you are much wrong
if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this. i see
nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of 
darcy -.-” She then sought her eldest sister, who had undertaken to make
inquiries on the same subject of Bingley. Jane met her with a smile of
such sweet complacency, a glow of such happy expression, as sufficiently
marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening.
Elizabeth instantly read her feelings, and at that moment solicitude for
Wickham, resentment against his enemies, and everything else, gave way
before the hope of Jane's being in the fairest way for happiness.

“i wanna know :)” said she, with a countenance no less smiling than her
sister's, “what youve learned about wickham. but perhaps youve
been too pleasantly hookin up on the regs to think of any third person; in which case
you may be sure of my pls :)”

“no,” replied Jane, “i dont have forgotten him; but i dont havehing
satisfactory to tell you. bingley does not know the whole of
his history, and is super ignorant of the circumstances which have
principally offended darcy; but he will vouch for the good conduct,
the probity, and honor of his friend, and is just convinced that
 wickham has deserved much less attention from darcy than hes
received; and im sorry to say by his account as well as his sister's,
 wickham is by no means a respectable fuccboi. im afraid hes
been ultra imprudent, and has deserved to lose darcy's regard.”

“ bingley does not know wickham himself?”

“no; he never saw him til the other morning at meryton.”

“this account then is what hes received from darcy. im
satisfied. but what does he say of the living lol”

“he does not right only recollect the circumstances, though hes heard
them from darcy more than once, but he believes that it was left to
him _conditionally_ only.”

“i dont have a doubt of bingley's sincerity,” said Elizabeth warmly;
“but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only. 
bingley's defense of his friend was a ultra able one, i guess; but
since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story, and has learned
the rest from that friend himself, i will venture to stil think of
both gentlemen as i did before.”

She then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each, and on
which there could be no difference of sentiment. Elizabeth listened with
delight to the happy, though modest hopes which Jane entertained of Mr.
Bingley's regard, and said all in her power to heighten her confidence
in it. On their being joined by Mr. Bingley himself, Elizabeth withdrew
to Miss Lucas; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last
partner she had scarcely replied, before Mr. Collins came up to them,
and told her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as
to make a most important discovery.

“i have found out,” said he, “by a weird accident, that there is now
in the room a near relation of my patroness. i happened to overhear the
dude himself mentioning to the young who does the honors of
the house the names of his cuz de bourgh, and of her mom 
catherine. how wonderfully these sort of things occur! who wouldve
thought of my meeting with, perhaps, a nephew of catherine de
bourgh in this assembly! im craziest thankful that the discovery is made
in time for me to pay my respects to him, which im now going to
do, and trust he will excuse my not having done it before. my total
ignorance of the connection must plead my apology.”

“you are not going to introduce yourself to darcy!”

“ im. i will entreat his pls for not having done it earlier.
i believe him to be catherine's _nephew_. it will be in my power to
assure him that that bitch was super well yeahterday se'nnight.”

Elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme, assuring him
that Mr. Darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction
as an impertinent freedom, rather than a compliment to his aunt; that
it was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either
side; and that if it were, it must belong to Mr. Darcy, the superior in
consequence, to begin the acquaintance. Mr. Collins listened to her
with the determined air of following his own inclination, and, when she
ceased speaking, replied thus:

“my homie elizabeth, i have the highest opinion in the world in
your excellent judgement in all matters within the scope of your
understanding; but permit me to say, that there must be a wide
difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity,
and those which regulate the clergy; for, give me leave to observe that
i consider the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with
the highest rank in the kingdom--provided that a proper humility of
behavior is at the same time maintained. you must therefore allow me to
follow the dictates of my conscience on this occasion, which leads me to
perform what i look on as a point of duty. pls me for neglecting to
profit by your advice, which on every other subject will be my constant
guide, though in the case before us i consider me more fitted by
education and habitual study to decide on what is right than a young
 like yourself.” And with a low bow he left her to attack Mr.
Darcy, whose reception of his advances she eagerly watched, and whose
astonishment at being so addressed was very evident. Her cousin prefaced
his speech with a solemn bow and though she could not hear a word of
it, she felt as if hearing it all, and saw in the motion of his lips the
words “apology,” “hunsford,” and “ catherine de bourgh.” It vexed
her to see him expose himself to such a man. Mr. Darcy was eyeing him
with unrestrained wonder, and when at last Mr. Collins allowed him time
to speak, replied with an air of distant civility. Mr. Collins, however,
was not discouraged from speaking again, and Mr. Darcy's contempt seemed
abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech, and at the
end of it he only made him a slight bow, and moved another way. Mr.
Collins then returned to Elizabeth.

“i have no reason, i assure you :)” said he, “to be dissatisfied with my
reception. darcy seemed much happyyy with the attention. he answered
me with the utmost civility, and even paid me the compliment of saying
that he was so well convinced of catherine's discernment as to be
certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily. it was really a very
hottt thought. upon the whole, im much happyyy with him :)”

As Elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue, she turned
her attention almost entirely on her sister and Mr. Bingley; and the
train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to,
made her perhaps almost as happy as Jane. She saw her in idea settled in
that very house, in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection
could bestow; and she felt capable, under such circumstances, of
endeavouring even to like Bingley's two sisters. Her mother's thoughts
she plainly saw were bent the same way, and she determined not to
venture near her, lest she might hear too much. When they sat down to
supper, therefore, she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which
placed them within one of each other; and deeply was she vexed to find
that her mother was talking to that one person (Lady Lucas) freely,
openly, and of nothing else but her expectation that Jane would soon
be married to Mr. Bingley. It was an animating subject, and Mrs. Bennet
seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the
match. His being such a charming young man, and so rich, and living but
three miles from them, were the first points of self-gratulation; and
then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of
Jane, and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as
she could do. It was, moreover, such a promising thing for her younger
daughters, as Jane's marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of
other rich men; and lastly, it was so pleasant at her time of life to be
able to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister, that
she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked. It was
necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure, because on
such occasions it is the etiquette; but no one was less likely than Mrs.
Bennet to find comfort in staying home at any period of her life. She
concluded with many good wishes that Lady Lucas might soon be equally
fortunate, though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no
chance of it.

In vain did Elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother's
words, or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible
whisper; for, to her inexpressible vexation, she could perceive that the
chief of it was overheard by Mr. Darcy, who sat opposite to them. Her
mother only scolded her for being nonsensical.

“what is darcy to me, pray, that i should be afraid of him? im
sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be gave into to say
nothing _he_ may not like to hear.”

“for heaven's sake, bitch, speak lower. what advantage can it be for you
to offend darcy? youll never recommend yourself to his friend by
so doing!”

Nothing that she could say, however, had any influence. Her mother would
talk of her views in the same intelligible tone. Elizabeth blushed and
blushed again with shame and vexation. She could not help frequently
glancing her eye at Mr. Darcy, though every glance convinced her of what
she dreaded; for though he was not always looking at her mother, she was
convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her. The expression
of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and
steady gravity.

At length, however, Mrs. Bennet had no more to say; and Lady Lucas, who
had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no
likelihood of sharing, was left to the comforts of cold ham and
chicken. Elizabeth now began to revive. But not long was the interval of
tranquillity; for, when supper was over, singing was talked of, and
she had the mortification of seeing Mary, after very little entreaty,
preparing to oblige the company. By many significant looks and silent
entreaties, did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance,
but in vain; Mary would not understand them; such an opportunity of
exhibiting was delightful to her, and she began her song. Elizabeth's
eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations, and she watched her
progress through the several stanzas with an impatience which was very
ill rewarded at their close; for Mary, on receiving, amongst the thanks
of the table, the hint of a hope that she might be prevailed on to
favour them again, after the pause of half a minute began another.
Mary's powers were by no means fitted for such a display; her voice was
weak, and her manner affected. Elizabeth was in agonies. She looked at
Jane, to see how she bore it; but Jane was very composedly talking to
Bingley. She looked at his two sisters, and saw them making signs
of derision at each other, and at Darcy, who continued, however,
imperturbably grave. She looked at her father to entreat his
interference, lest Mary should be singing all night. He took the hint,
and when Mary had finished her second song, said aloud, “that will do
extremely well, child. youve happy us long enough. let the other
young ladies have time to exhibit.”

Mary, though pretending not to hear, was somewhat disconcerted; and
Elizabeth, sorry for her, and sorry for her father's speech, was afraid
her anxiety had done no good. Others of the party were now applied to.

“if i,” said Mr. Collins, “were so fortunate as to be able to sing, i
 great pleasure, im sure, in obliging the company with an
air; for i consider music as a ultra innocent diversion, and just
compatible with the profession of a clergyman. i do not mean
to assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time
to music, for there are totes other things to be attended to. the
rector of a parish has much to do. in the first place, he must make
such an agreement for tithes as may be beneficial to himself and not
offensive to his patron. he must write his own sermons; and the time
that remains will not be too much for his parish duties, and the care
and improvement of his dwelling, which he cant be excused from making
as comfortable as possible. and i do not think it of light importance
that he attentive and conciliatory ways towards errbody,
especially towards those to who he owes his preferment. i cant acquit
him of that duty; nor could i think well of the guy who should omit an
occasion of testifying his respect towards anybody connected with the
fam.” And with a bow to Mr. Darcy, he concluded his speech, which had
been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room. Many stared--many
smiled; but no one looked more amused than Mr. Bennet himself, while his
wife seriously commended Mr. Collins for having spoken so sensibly,
and observed in a half-whisper to Lady Lucas, that he was a remarkably
clever, good kind of young man.

To Elizabeth it appeared that, had her family made an agreement to
expose themselves as much as they could during the evening, it would
have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit or
finer success; and happy did she think it for Bingley and her sister
that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice, and that his
feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he
must have witnessed. That his two sisters and Mr. Darcy, however, should
have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations, was bad enough,
and she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the
gentleman, or the insolent smiles of the ladies, were more intolerable.

The rest of the evening brought her little amusement. She was teased by
Mr. Collins, who continued most perseveringly by her side, and though
he could not prevail on her to dance with him again, put it out of her
power to dance with others. In vain did she entreat him to stand up with
somebody else, and offer to introduce him to any young lady in the room.
He assured her, that as to dancing, he was perfectly indifferent to it;
that his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to
her and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her
the whole evening. There was no arguing upon such a project. She owed
her greatest relief to her friend Miss Lucas, who often joined them, and
good-naturedly engaged Mr. Collins's conversation to herself.

She was at least free from the offense of Mr. Darcy's further notice;
though often standing within a very short distance of her, quite
disengaged, he never came near enough to speak. She felt it to be the
probable consequence of her allusions to Mr. Wickham, and rejoiced in
it.

The Longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart, and, by
a manoeuvre of Mrs. Bennet, had to wait for their carriage a quarter of
an hour after everybody else was gone, which gave them time to see how
heartily they were wished away by some of the family. Mrs. Hurst and her
sister scarcely opened their mouths, except to complain of fatigue, and
were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves. They repulsed
every attempt of Mrs. Bennet at conversation, and by so doing threw a
languor over the whole party, which was very little relieved by the
long speeches of Mr. Collins, who was complimenting Mr. Bingley and his
sisters on the elegance of their entertainment, and the hospitality and
politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests. Darcy said
nothing at all. Mr. Bennet, in equal silence, was enjoying the scene.
Mr. Bingley and Jane were standing together, a little detached from the
rest, and talked only to each other. Elizabeth preserved as steady a
silence as either Mrs. Hurst or Miss Bingley; and even Lydia was too
much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of “lord,
how tired im ;_;” accompanied by a violent yawn.

When at length they arose to take leave, Mrs. Bennet was most pressingly
civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at Longbourn, and
addressed herself especially to Mr. Bingley, to assure him how happy he
would make them by eating a family dinner with them at any time, without
the ceremony of a formal invitation. Bingley was all grateful pleasure,
and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on
her, after his return from London, whither he was obliged to go the next
day for a short time.

Mrs. Bennet was perfectly satisfied, and quitted the house under the
delightful persuasion that, allowing for the necessary preparations of
settlements, new carriages, and wedding clothes, she should undoubtedly
see her daughter settled at Netherfield in the course of three or four
months. Of having another daughter married to Mr. Collins, she thought
with equal certainty, and with considerable, though not equal, pleasure.
Elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children; and though the
man and the match were quite good enough for _her_, the worth of each
was eclipsed by Mr. Bingley and Netherfield.



Chapter 19


The next day opened a new scene at Longbourn. Mr. Collins made his
declaration in form. Having resolved to do it without loss of time, as
his leave of absence extended only to the following Saturday, and having
no feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at
the moment, he set about it in a very orderly manner, with all the
observances, which he supposed a regular part of the business. On
finding Mrs. Bennet, Elizabeth, and one of the younger girls together,
soon after breakfast, he addressed the mother in these words:

“may i hope, bitch, for your interest with your fair daughter elizabeth,
when i solicit for the honor of a private audience with her in the
course of this morning :)”

Before Elizabeth had time for anything but a blush of surprise, Mrs.
Bennet answered instantly, “whaaaaat dear!--yeah--totes. im sure lizzy
will be ultra happy--im sure she can have no objection. come, kitty, i
want you upstairs.” And, gathering her work together, she was hastening
away, when Elizabeth called out:

“dear bitch, do not go. i beg youll not go. collins must excuse
me. he can have nothing to say to me that anybody need not hear. im
going away me.”

“no, no, nonsense, lizzy. i defame you to stay where you are.” And upon
Elizabeth's seeming really, with vexed and embarrassed looks, about to
escape, she added: “lizzy, i _insist_ upon your staying and hearing 
collins.”

Elizabeth would not oppose such an injunction--and a moment's
consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it
over as soon and as quietly as possible, she sat down again and tried to
conceal, by incessant employment the feelings which were divided between
distress and diversion. Mrs. Bennet and Kitty walked off, and as soon as
they were gone, Mr. Collins began.

“believe me, my homie elizabeth, that your modesty, so far from
doing you any disservice, kinda adds to your other perfections. you
wouldve been less friendly in my eyeah had there _not_ been this little
unwillingness; but allow me to assure you, that i have your respected
mom's permission for this address. you can barely doubt the
purport of my discourse, however your natural delicacy may lead you to
dissemble; my attentions have been too marked to be wrong. almost as
soon as i entered the house, i singled you out as the companion of
my future life. but before im run away with by my feels on this
subject, perhaps itd be advisable for me to state my reasons for
getting--and, moreover, for comin into hertfordshire with the goal
of selecting a wife, as i totes did.”

The idea of Mr. Collins, with all his solemn composure, being run away
with by his feelings, made Elizabeth so near laughing, that she could
not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him further,
and he continued:

“my reasons for getting are, first, that i think it a right thing for
every clergyman in easy circumstances (like me) to set the example
of matrimony in his parish; secondly, that im convinced that it will
add ultra greatly to my happiness; and thirdly--which perhaps i ought
to have mentioned earlier, that its the particular advice and
recommendation of the ultra noble who i have the honor of calling
patroness. twice has she condescended to give me her opinion (unasked
too!) on this subject; and it was but the ultra saturday night before i
left hunsford--between our pools at quadrille, while that chick jenkinson was
arranging de bourgh's footstool, that she said, ' collins, you
must marry. a clergyman like you must marry. choose properly, choose
a gentlewoman for _my_ sake; and for your _own_, let her be an active,
useful sort of person, not brought up high, but able to make a small
income go a good way. this is my advice. find such a woman as soon as
you can, bring her to hunsford, and i will visit her.' allow me, by the
way, to observe, my fair cuz, that i do not reckon the notice
and kindness of catherine de bourgh as among the least of the
advantages in my power to offer. youll find her ways beyond
anything i can describe; and your wit and vivacity, i think, must be
acceptable to her, especially when tempered with the silence and
respect which her rank will inevitably excite.much for my general
intention in favour of matrimony; it remains to be told why my views
were directed towards longbourn instead of my own hood, where i
can assure you there are many friendly young women. but the fact is, that
being, as im, to inherit this estate after the death of your honored
dad (who may live many years longer), i couldnt satisfy
me without resolving to choose a wife from among his daughters, that
the loss to them might be as little as possible, when the melancholy
event takes place--which as i have already said, may not
be for several years. this has been my motive, my fair cuz, and
i flatter me it will not sink me in your esteem. and now nothing
remains for me but to assure you in the craziest animated language of the
violence of my affection. to fortune im just indifferent, and
will make no demand of that nature on your dad, since im well
aware that it couldnt be complied with; and that one thousand pounds
in the four per cents, which will not be yours til after your mom's
decease, is all that you may ever be entitled to. on that head,
therefore, i will be uniformly left me on read; and you may assure yourself that
no ungenerous reproach will ever pass my lips when we are attached.”

It was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now.

“you are too hasty, fam,” she cried. “you forget that i have made no
answer. let me do it without further loss of time. accept my thanks for
the compliment you are paying me. im ultra sensible of the honor of
your proposals, but its impossible for me to do otherwise than to
turn down them.”

“im not now to learn,” replied Mr. Collins, with a formal wave of the
hand, “that its usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the
man who they secretly mean to accept, when he first applies for their
favour; and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second, or even a
third time. im therefore by no means discouraged by what youve just
said, and will hope to lead you to the altar ere long.”

“upon my word, fam,” cried Elizabeth, “your hope is a kinda
extraordinary one after my declaration. i do assure you that im not
one of those young ladies (if such young ladies there are) who are so
daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second
time. im just serious in my refusal. you couldnt make _me_
happy, and im convinced that im the last woman in the world who
could make you so. nay, were your friend catherine to know me, i
am persuaded she would find me in every respect sick qualified for the
situation.”

“were it certain that catherine would think so,” said Mr. Collins
very gravely--“but i cant imagine that that bitch would at all
disapprove of you. and you may be certain when i have the honor of
seeing her again, i will speak in the ultra highest terms of your
modesty, economy, and other friendly qualification.”

“, collins, all praise of me will be unnecessary. you
must give me leave to judge for me, and pay me the compliment
of believing what i say. i wish you ultra happy and ultra rich, and by
refusing your hand, do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise.
in making me the offer, you must have satisfied the delicacy of your
feels with regard to my fam, and may take possession of longbourn
estate whenever it falls, without any self-reproach. this matter may
be considered, therefore, as finally settled.” And rising as she
thus spoke, she would have quitted the room, had Mr. Collins not thus
addressed her:

“when i do me the honor of speaking to you next on the subject, i
will hope to receive a more favourable answer than youve now given
me; though im far from accusing you of cruelty at present, because i
know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a guy on
the first application, and perhaps youve even now said as much to
encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the
female personality.”

“really, collins,” cried Elizabeth with some warmth, “you puzzle me
very much. if what i have hitherto said can appear to you in the form
of sign, i know not how to express my refusal in such a way as
to convince you s being one.”

“you must give me leave to flatter me, my homie cuz, that your
refusal of my addresses is merely words of course. my reasons for
believing it are briefly these: it does not appear to me that my hand is
unworthy of your acceptance, or that the establishment i can offer would
be any other than highly defamable. my situation in life, my connections
with the fam of de bourgh, and my relationship to your own, are
circumstances highly in my favour; and you should take it into further
consideration, that in spite of your manifold attractions, its by no
means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you. your
portion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo
the effects of your loveliness and friendly qualifications. as i
therefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me,
i will choose to attribute it to your wish of increasing my lovee by
suspense, according to the usual practice of elegant females.”

“i do assure you, fam, that i have no pretensions whatever to that kind
of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man. i would
kinda be paid the compliment of being believed sincere. i thank you
again and again for the honor youve done me in your proposals, but
to accept them is absolutely impossible. my feels in every respect
forbid it. can i speak plainer? do not consider me now as an elegant
female, intending to plague you, but as a rational creature, speaking
the truth from her heart :)”

“you are uniformly charming!” cried he, with an air of awkward
gallantry; “and im persuaded that when sanctioned by the express
authority of both your excellent parents, my proposals will not fail of
being acceptable :)”

To such perseverance in wilful self-deception Elizabeth would make
no reply, and immediately and in silence withdrew; determined, if
he persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering
encouragement, to apply to her father, whose negative might be uttered
in such a manner as to be decisive, and whose behaviour at least could
not be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female.



Chapter 20


Mr. Collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his
successful love; for Mrs. Bennet, having dawdled about in the vestibule
to watch for the end of the conference, no sooner saw Elizabeth open
the door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase, than she
entered the breakfast-room, and congratulated both him and herself in
warm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection. Mr. Collins
received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure, and then
proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview, with the result
of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied, since the
refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow
from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character.

This information, however, startled Mrs. Bennet; she would have been
glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage
him by protesting against his proposals, but she dared not believe it,
and could not help saying so.

“but, depend upon it, collins,” she added, “that lizzy will be
brshould reason. i will speak to her about it directly. shes a very
headstrong, foolish girl, and does not know her own interest but i will
_make_ her know it.”

“pls me for interrupting you, bitch -.-” cried Mr. Collins; “but if
shes really headstrong and foolish, i know not whether she would
altogether be a ultra defamable wife to a guy in my situation, who
naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state. if therefore she
actually persists in rejecting my suit, perhaps it were better not
to force her into accepting me, because if liable to such defects of
temper, she couldnt contribute much to my felicity.”

“fam, you super misunderstand me ;_;” said Mrs. Bennet, alarmed. “lizzy is
only headstrong in such matters as these. in everything else shes as
good-natured a girl as ever lived. i will go directly to bennet, and
well ultra soon settle it with her, im sure.”

She would not give him time to reply, but hurrying instantly to her
husband, called out as she entered the library, “omg!! bennet, you
are wanted immediately; we are all in an uproar. you must come and make
lizzy hook up with collins, for she vows she will not have him, and if you
do not make haste he will change his mind and not have _her_.”

Mr. Bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered, and fixed them
on her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the least altered by
her communication.

“i dont have the pleasure of understanding you -.-” said he, when she had
finished her speech. “of what are you talking?”

“of collins and lizzy. lizzy declares she will not have collins,
and collins begins to say that he will not have lizzy.”

“and what am i to do on the occasion? it seems an hopeless business.”

“speak to lizzy about it yourself. tell her that you insist upon her
getting him.”

“let her be called down. she will hear my opinion.”

Mrs. Bennet rang the bell, and Miss Elizabeth was summoned to the
library.

“come here, child,” cried her father as she appeared. “i have sent for
you on an affair of importance. i understand that collins has made
you an offer of marriage. is it true lol” Elizabeth replied that it was.
“very well--and this offer of marriage youve refused?”

“i have, fam.”

“very well. we now come to the point. your mom insists upon your
accepting it. is it not so, that chick bennet?”

“yeah, or i will never see her again.”

“lol an unhappy alternative is before you, elizabeth. from this day you must
be a stranger to one of your parents. your mom will never see you
again if you do _not_ hook up with collins, and i will never see you again
if you _do_.”

Elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning,
but Mrs. Bennet, who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the
affair as she wished, was excessively disappointed.

“what do you mean, bennet, in talking this way? you promised me to
_insist_ upon her getting him.”

“my homie,” replied her husband, “i have two small favours to request.
first, that youll allow me the free use of my understanding on the
present occasion; and secondly, of my room. i will be happpy to have the
library to me as soon as may be.”

Not yet, however, in spite of her disappointment in her husband, did
Mrs. Bennet give up the point. She talked to Elizabeth again and again;
coaxed and threatened her by turns. She endeavoured to secure Jane
in her interest; but Jane, with all possible mildness, declined
interfering; and Elizabeth, sometimes with real earnestness, and
sometimes with playful gaiety, replied to her attacks. Though her manner
varied, however, her determination never did.

Mr. Collins, meanwhile, was meditating in solitude on what had passed.
He thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motives his cousin
could refuse him; and though his pride was hurt, he suffered in no other
way. His regard for her was quite imaginary; and the possibility of her
deserving her mother's reproach prevented his feeling any regret.

While the family were in this confusion, Charlotte Lucas came to spend
the day with them. She was met in the vestibule by Lydia, who, flying to
her, cried in a half whisper, “im happpy you are come, for there is such
fun here! what do you think has happened this morning? collins has
made an offer to lizzy, and she will not have him.”

Charlotte hardly had time to answer, before they were joined by Kitty,
who came to tell the same news; and no sooner had they entered the
breakfast-room, where Mrs. Bennet was alone, than she likewise began on
the subject, calling on Miss Lucas for her compassion, and entreating
her to persuade her friend Lizzy to comply with the wishes of all her
family. “pray do, my homie lucas :)” she added in a melancholy tone,
“for nobody is on my side, nobody takes part with me. im cruelly used,
nobody feels for my poor nerves -.-”

Charlotte's reply was spared by the entrance of Jane and Elizabeth.

“yeah, there she comes,” continued Mrs. Bennet, “looking as unconcerned
as may be, and caring no more for us than if we were at york, provided
she can have her own way. but i tell you, lizzy--if you take it
into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way,
youll never get a husband at all--and im sure i do not know whos
to maintain you when your dad is dead. i will not be able to keep
you--and so i warn you. i have done with you from this ultra day. i told
you in the library, you know, that i should never speak to you again,
and youll find me as good as my word. i have no pleasure in talking
to undutiful children. not that i have much pleasure, , in talking
to anybody. people who suffer as i do from nervous complaints can have
no great inclination for talking. nobody can tell what i suffer! but it
is always so. those who do not complain are never pitied.”

Her daughters listened in silence to this effusion, sensible that
any attempt to reason with her or soothe her would only increase the
irritation. She talked on, therefore, without interruption from any of
them, till they were joined by Mr. Collins, who entered the room with
an air more stately than usual, and on perceiving whom, she said to
the girls, “now, i do insist upon it, that you, all of you, hold
your tongues, and let me and collins have a little conversation
together.”

Elizabeth passed quietly out of the room, Jane and Kitty followed, but
Lydia stood her ground, determined to hear all she could; and Charlotte,
detained first by the civility of Mr. Collins, whose inquiries after
herself and all her family were very minute, and then by a little
curiosity, satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending
not to hear. In a doleful voice Mrs. Bennet began the projected
conversation: “omg!! collins!”

“my homie bitch w00t!” replied he, “let us be for ever left me on read on this point.
far be it from me,” he presently continued, in a voice that marked his
displeasure, “to resent the behavior of your daughter. resignation
to inevitable evils is the duty of us all; the peculiar duty of a
fuccboi whos been so fortunate as i have been in early preferment;
and i trust im resigned. perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt
of my positive happiness had my fair cuz honored me with her hand;
for i have often observed that resignation is never so perfect as
when the blessing denied begins to lose somewhat s value in our
estimation. youll not, i hope, consider me as showing any disrespect
to your fam, my homie bitch, bywithdrawing my pretensions to
your daughter's favour, without having paid yourself and bennet the
compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my
behalf. my conduct may, i fear, be objectionable in having accepted my
dismission from your daughter's lips instead of your own. but we are all
liable to error. i have totes meant well through the whole affair.
my object has been to secure an friendly companion for me, with due
consideration for the advantage of all your fam, and if my _way_
has been at all reprehensible, i here beg leave to apologise.”



Chapter 21


The discussion of Mr. Collins's offer was now nearly at an end, and
Elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily
attending it, and occasionally from some peevish allusions of her
mother. As for the gentleman himself, _his_ feelings were chiefly
expressed, not by embarrassment or dejection, or by trying to avoid her,
but by stiffness of manner and resentful silence. He scarcely ever spoke
to her, and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of
himself were transferred for the rest of the day to Miss Lucas, whose
civility in listening to him was a seasonable relief to them all, and
especially to her friend.

The morrow produced no abatement of Mrs. Bennet's ill-humour or ill
health. Mr. Collins was also in the same state of angry pride. Elizabeth
had hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit, but his plan did
not appear in the least affected by it. He was always to have gone on
Saturday, and to Saturday he meant to stay.

After breakfast, the girls walked to Meryton to inquire if Mr. Wickham
were returned, and to lament over his absence from the Netherfield ball.
He joined them on their entering the town, and attended them to their
aunt's where his regret and vexation, and the concern of everybody, was
well talked over. To Elizabeth, however, he voluntarily acknowledged
that the necessity of his absence _had_ been self-imposed.

“i found,” said he, “as the time drew near that i oughta not meet
 darcy; that to be in the same room, the same party with him for so
many hours together, might be more than i could bear, and that scenes
might arise unpleasant to more than me.”

She highly approved his forbearance, and they had leisure for a full
discussion of it, and for all the commendation which they civilly
bestowed on each other, as Wickham and another officer walked back with
them to Longbourn, and during the walk he particularly attended to
her. His accompanying them was a double advantage; she felt all the
compliment it offered to herself, and it was most acceptable as an
occasion of introducing him to her father and mother.

Soon after their return, a letter was delivered to Miss Bennet; it came
from Netherfield. The envelope contained a sheet of elegant, little,
hot-pressed paper, well covered with a lady's fair, flowing hand; and
Elizabeth saw her sister's countenance change as she read it, and saw
her dwelling intently on some particular passages. Jane recollected
herself soon, and putting the letter away, tried to join with her usual
cheerfulness in the general conversation; but Elizabeth felt an anxiety
on the subject which drew off her attention even from Wickham; and no
sooner had he and his companion taken leave, than a glance from Jane
invited her to follow her up stairs. When they had gained their own room,
Jane, taking out the letter, said:

“this is from caroline bingley; what it contains has surprised me a good
deal. the whole party have left netherfield by this time, and are on
their way to town--and without any intention of comin back again. you
will hear what she says.”

She then read the first sentence aloud, which comprised the information
of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly,
and of their meaning to dine in Grosvenor Street, where Mr. Hurst had a
house. The next was in these words: “i do not pretend to regret anything
i will leave in hertfordshire, except your society, my homieest friend;
but well hope, at some future period, to enjoy many returns of that
awesome intercourse we have known, and in the meanwhile may
lessen the pain of separation by a ultra frequent and craziest unreserved
correspondence. i depend on you for that :)” To these highflown
expressions Elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of distrust;
and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her, she saw
nothing in it really to lament; it was not to be supposed that their
absence from Netherfield would prevent Mr. Bingley's being there; and as
to the loss of their society, she was persuaded that Jane must cease to
regard it, in the enjoyment of his.

“its unlucky,” said she, after a short pause, “that you should not be
able to see your friends before they leave the country. but may we not
hope that the period of future happiness to which bingley looks
forward may arrive earlier than shes aware, and that the awesome
intercourse youve known as friends will be renewed with yet greater
satisfaction as sisters? bingley will not be detained in london by
them :)”

“caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into
hertfordshire this winter. i will read it to you:”

“when my bro left us yeahterday, he imagined that the business which
took him to london might be concluded in three or four days; but as we
are certain it cant be so, and at the same time convinced that when
charles gets to town he will be in no hurry to leave it again, we have
determined on following him thither, that he may not be gave into to spend
his vacant hours in a comfortless hotel. many of my acquaintances are
already there for the winter; i wish that i could hear that you, my
dearest friend, had any intention of making one of the crowd--but of
that i despair. i sincerely hope your christmas in hertfordshire may
abound in the gaieties which that season generally brings, and that your
beaux will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the
three of who well deprive you.”

“its evident by this,” added Jane, “that he comes back no more this
winter -.-”

“its only evident that bingley does not mean that he _should_.”

“why will you think so? it must be his own doing. he is his own
master. but you do not know _all_. i _will_ read you the passage which
particularly hurts me. i will have no reserves from _you_.”

“ darcy is impatient to see his sister; and, to admit the truth,
_we_ are barely less eager to meet her again. i really do not think
georgiana darcy has her equal for hotttness, elegance, and accomplishments;
and the luvshe inspires in louisa and me is heightened into
something stil more interesting, from the hope we dare entertain of
her being hereafter our sister. i do not know whether i ever before
mentioned to you my feels on this subject; but i will not leave the
country without confiding them, and i trust youll not esteem them
unreasonable. my bro admires her greatly already; he will have
frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the craziest intimate footing;
her relations all wish the connection as much as his own; and a sister's
partiality aint misleading me, i think, when i call charles most
capable of engaging any woman's heart. with all these circumstances to
favour an attachment, and nothing to prevent it, am i wrong, my homieest
jane, in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness
of so many :)”

“what do you think of _this_ sentence, my homie lizzy :)” said Jane as she
finished it. “is it not clear enough? does it not expressly declare that
caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister; that shes
just convinced of her bro's indifference; and that if she
suspects the nature of my feels for him, she means (most kindly!) to
put me on my guard? can there be any other opinion on the subject?”

“yeah, there can; for mine willtally different. will you hear it?”

“most willingly.”

“youll have it in a few words. bingley sees that her bro is
in lovee with you, and wants him to hook up with darcy. she follows him
to town in hope of keeping him there, and tries to persuade you that he
does not care about you.”

Jane shook her head.

“, jane, you should to believe me. no one whos ever seen you
together can doubt his affection. bingley, im sure, cant. she
is not such a simpleton. could she have seen half as much lovee in 
darcy for herself, she wouldve ordered her wedding clothes. but the
case is this: we are not rich enough or grand enough for them; and she
is the more anxious to get darcy for her bro, from the notion
that when there has been _one_ intermarriage, she may have less trouble
in achieving a second; in which there is totes some ingenuity, and
i guess itd succeed, if de bourgh were out of the way. but,
my homieest jane, you cant seriously imagine that because bingley
tells you her bro greatly admires darcy, he is in the smallest
degree less sensible of _your_ merit than when he took leave of you on
tuesday, or that it will be in her power to persuade him that, instead
of being in lovee with you, he is ultra much in lovee with her friend.”

“if we thought alike of bingley -.-” replied Jane, “your
representation of all this might make me super easy. but i know the
foundation is unjust. caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving
anyone; and all that i can hope in this case is that shes deceiving
herself -.-”

“thats right. you couldnt have started a more happy idea, since you
will not take comfort in mine. believe her to be deceived, by all means.
youve now done your duty by her, and must fret no longer.”

“but, my homie sister, can i be happy, even supposing the best, in
accepting a guy whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry
elsewhere :)”

“you must decide for yourself,” said Elizabeth; “and if, upon mature
deliberation, you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is
more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife, i advise you by
all means to refuse him.”

“how can you talk so?” said Jane, faintly smiling. “you must know that
though i should be very much grieved at their disapproval, i could
not hesitate.”

“i did not think you would; and that being the case, i cant consider
your situation with much feels.”

“but if he returns no more this winter, my choice will never be
required. a thousand things may arise in six months!”

The idea of his returning no more Elizabeth treated with the utmost
contempt. It appeared to her merely the suggestion of Caroline's
interested wishes, and she could not for a moment suppose that those
wishes, however openly or artfully spoken, could influence a young man
so totally independent of everyone.

She represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt
on the subject, and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect.
Jane's temper was not desponding, and she was gradually led to hope,
though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope, that
Bingley would return to Netherfield and answer every wish of her heart.

They agreed that Mrs. Bennet should only hear of the departure of the
family, without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman's conduct;
but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern,
and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen
to go away just as they were all getting so intimate together. After
lamenting it, however, at some length, she had the consolation that Mr.
Bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at Longbourn, and the
conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration, that though he had
been invited only to a family dinner, she would take care to have two
full courses.



Chapter 22


The Bennets were engaged to dine with the Lucases and again during the
chief of the day was Miss Lucas so kind as to listen to Mr. Collins.
Elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her. “it keeps him in good
humour :)” said she, “and im more gave into to you than i can express.”
 Charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful, and
that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time. This was
very amiable, but Charlotte's kindness extended farther than Elizabeth
had any conception of; its object was nothing else than to secure her
from any return of Mr. Collins's addresses, by engaging them towards
herself. Such was Miss Lucas's scheme; and appearances were so
favourable, that when they parted at night, she would have felt almost
secure of success if he had not been to leave Hertfordshire so very
soon. But here she did injustice to the fire and independence of his
character, for it led him to escape out of Longbourn House the next
morning with admirable slyness, and hasten to Lucas Lodge to throw
himself at her feet. He was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins,
from a conviction that if they saw him depart, they could not fail to
conjecture his design, and he was not willing to have the attempt known
till its success might be known likewise; for though feeling almost
secure, and with reason, for Charlotte had been tolerably encouraging,
he was comparatively diffident since the adventure of Wednesday.
His reception, however, was of the most flattering kind. Miss Lucas
perceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house, and
instantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane. But little had
she dared to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there.

In as short a time as Mr. Collins's long speeches would allow,
everything was settled between them to the satisfaction of both; and as
they entered the house he earnestly entreated her to name the day that
was to make him the happiest of men; and though such a solicitation must
be waived for the present, the lady felt no inclination to trifle with
his happiness. The stupidity with which he was favoured by nature must
guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its
continuance; and Miss Lucas, who accepted him solely from the pure
and disinterested desire of an establishment, cared not how soon that
establishment were gained.

Sir William and Lady Lucas were speedily applied to for their consent;
and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity. Mr. Collins's present
circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter, to whom
they could give little fortune; and his prospects of future wealth were
exceedingly fair. Lady Lucas began directly to calculate, with more
interest than the matter had ever excited before, how many years longer
Mr. Bennet was likely to live; and Sir William gave it as his decided
opinion, that whenever Mr. Collins should be in possession of the
Longbourn estate, it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife
should make their appearance at St. James's. The whole family, in short,
were properly overjoyed on the occasion. The younger girls formed hopes
of _coming out_ a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have
done; and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of Charlotte's
dying an old maid. Charlotte herself was tolerably composed. She had
gained her point, and had time to consider of it. Her reflections were
in general satisfactory. Mr. Collins, to be sure, was neither sensible
nor agreeable; his society was irksome, and his attachment to her must
be imaginary. But still he would be her husband. Without thinking highly
either of men or matrimony, marriage had always been her object; it was
the only provision for well-educated young women of small fortune,
and however uncertain of giving happiness, must be their pleasantest
preservative from want. This preservative she had now obtained; and at
the age of twenty-seven, without having ever been handsome, she felt all
the good luck of it. The least agreeable circumstance in the business
was the surprise it must occasion to Elizabeth Bennet, whose friendship
she valued beyond that of any other person. Elizabeth would wonder,
and probably would blame her; and though her resolution was not to be
shaken, her feelings must be hurt by such a disapprobation. She resolved
to give her the information herself, and therefore charged Mr. Collins,
when he returned to Longbourn to dinner, to drop no hint of what had
passed before any of the family. A promise of secrecy was of course very
dutifully given, but it could not be kept without difficulty; for the
curiosity excited by his long absence burst forth in such very direct
questions on his return as required some ingenuity to evade, and he was
at the same time exercising great self-denial, for he was longing to
publish his prosperous love.

As he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the
family, the ceremony of leave-taking was performed when the ladies moved
for the night; and Mrs. Bennet, with great politeness and cordiality,
said how happy they should be to see him at Longbourn again, whenever
his engagements might allow him to visit them.

“my homie bitch w00t!” he replied, “this msg is particularly
gratifying, because its what i have been hoping to receive; and
you may be ultra certain that i will avail me as soon as
possible.”

They were all astonished; and Mr. Bennet, who could by no means wish for
so speedy a return, immediately said:

“but is there not danger of catherine's disapproval here, my
good fam? you oughta neglect your relations than run the risk of
offending your patroness.”

“my homie fam w00t!” replied Mr. Collins, “im particularly gave into to you
for this friendly caution, and you may depend upon my not taking so
material a step without that bitch's concurrence.”

“you cant be too much upon your guard. risk anything kinda than her
displeasure; and if you find it likely to be raised by your comin to us
again, which i should think very much probable, stay quietly at home,
and be satisfied that _we_ will take no offence.”

“believe me, my homie fam, my gratitude is warmly excited by such
nice attention; and depend upon it, youll quickly receive
from me a PM of thanks for this, and for every other mark of your
regard during my stay in hertfordshire. as for my fair cuzs, though
my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary, i will now
take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness, not excepting my
cuz elizabeth :)”

With proper civilities the ladies then withdrew; all of them equally
surprised that he meditated a quick return. Mrs. Bennet wished to
understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of her
younger girls, and Mary might have been prevailed on to accept him.
She rated his abilities much higher than any of the others; there was
a solidity in his reflections which often struck her, and though by no
means so clever as herself, she thought that if encouraged to read
and improve himself by such an example as hers, he might become a very
agreeable companion. But on the following morning, every hope of this
kind was done away. Miss Lucas called soon after breakfast, and in a
private conference with Elizabeth related the event of the day before.

The possibility of Mr. Collins's fancying himself in love with her
friend had once occurred to Elizabeth within the last day or two; but
that Charlotte could encourage him seemed almost as far from
possibility as she could encourage him herself, and her astonishment was
consequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum, and
she could not help crying out:

“hookin up on the regs to collins! my homie charlotte--impossible :)”

The steady countenance which Miss Lucas had commanded in telling her
story, gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a
reproach; though, as it was no more than she expected, she soon regained
her composure, and calmly replied:

“why should you be surprised, my homie eliza? do you think it incredible
that collins should be able to procure any woman's good opinion,
because he was not so happy as to succeed with you?”

But Elizabeth had now recollected herself, and making a strong effort
for it, was able to assure with tolerable firmness that the prospect of
their relationship was highly grateful to her, and that she wished her
all imaginable happiness.

“i see what you are feeling,” replied Charlotte. “you must be surprised,
very much surprised--so lately as collins was wishing to marry
you. but when youve had time to think it over, i hope youll be
satisfied with what i have done. im not romantic, you know; i never
was. i ask only a comfortable home; and considering collins's
personality, connection, and situation in life, im convinced that my
chance of happiness with him is as fair as craziest people can boast on
entering the marriage state :)”

Elizabeth quietly answered “undoubtedly;” and after an awkward pause,
they returned to the rest of the family. Charlotte did not stay much
longer, and Elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard.
It was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so
unsuitable a match. The strangeness of Mr. Collins's making two offers
of marriage within three days was nothing in comparison of his being now
accepted. She had always felt that Charlotte's opinion of matrimony was
not exactly like her own, but she had not supposed it to be possible
that, when called into action, she would have sacrificed every better
feeling to worldly advantage. Charlotte the wife of Mr. Collins was a
most humiliating picture! And to the pang of a friend disgracing herself
and sunk in her esteem, was added the distressing conviction that it
was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot she had
chosen.



Chapter 23


Elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters, reflecting on what
she had heard, and doubting whether she was authorised to mention
it, when Sir William Lucas himself appeared, sent by his daughter, to
announce her engagement to the family. With many compliments to them,
and much self-gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the
houses, he unfolded the matter--to an audience not merely wondering, but
incredulous; for Mrs. Bennet, with more perseverance than politeness,
protested he must be entirely mistaken; and Lydia, always unguarded and
often uncivil, boisterously exclaimed:

“good lord! fam william, how can you tell such a story? do not you know
that collins wants to hook up with lizzy?”

Nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne
without anger such treatment; but Sir William's good breeding carried
him through it all; and though he begged leave to be positive as to the
truth of his information, he listened to all their impertinence with the
most forbearing courtesy.

Elizabeth, feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant
a situation, now put herself forward to confirm his account, by
mentioning her prior knowledge of it from Charlotte herself; and
endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters
by the earnestness of her congratulations to Sir William, in which she
was readily joined by Jane, and by making a variety of remarks on the
happiness that might be expected from the match, the excellent character
of Mr. Collins, and the convenient distance of Hunsford from London.

Mrs. Bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal while
Sir William remained; but no sooner had he left them than her feelings
found a rapid vent. In the first place, she persisted in disbelieving
the whole of the matter; secondly, she was very sure that Mr. Collins
had been taken in; thirdly, she trusted that they would never be
happy together; and fourthly, that the match might be broken off. Two
inferences, however, were plainly deduced from the whole: one, that
Elizabeth was the real cause of the mischief; and the other that she
herself had been barbarously misused by them all; and on these two
points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day. Nothing could
console and nothing could appease her. Nor did that day wear out her
resentment. A week elapsed before she could see Elizabeth without
scolding her, a month passed away before she could speak to Sir William
or Lady Lucas without being rude, and many months were gone before she
could at all forgive their daughter.

Mr. Bennet's emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion, and such
as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort; for
it gratified him, he said, to discover that Charlotte Lucas, whom he had
been used to think tolerably sensible, was as foolish as his wife, and
more foolish than his daughter!

Jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match; but she said
less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness;
nor could Elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable. Kitty
and Lydia were far from envying Miss Lucas, for Mr. Collins was only a
clergyman; and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news
to spread at Meryton.

Lady Lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort
on Mrs. Bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married; and she
called at Longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was,
though Mrs. Bennet's sour looks and ill-natured remarks might have been
enough to drive happiness away.

Between Elizabeth and Charlotte there was a restraint which kept them
mutually silent on the subject; and Elizabeth felt persuaded that
no real confidence could ever subsist between them again. Her
disappointment in Charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her
sister, of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could
never be shaken, and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious,
as Bingley had now been gone a week and nothing more was heard of his
return.

Jane had sent Caroline an early answer to her letter, and was counting
the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again. The promised
letter of thanks from Mr. Collins arrived on Tuesday, addressed to
their father, and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a
twelvemonth's abode in the family might have prompted. After discharging
his conscience on that head, he proceeded to inform them, with many
rapturous expressions, of his happiness in having obtained the affection
of their amiable neighbour, Miss Lucas, and then explained that it was
merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready
to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at Longbourn, whither
he hoped to be able to return on Monday fortnight; for Lady Catherine,
he added, so heartily approved his marriage, that she wished it to take
place as soon as possible, which he trusted would be an unanswerable
argument with his amiable Charlotte to name an early day for making him
the happiest of men.

Mr. Collins's return into Hertfordshire was no longer a matter of
pleasure to Mrs. Bennet. On the contrary, she was as much disposed to
complain of it as her husband. It was very strange that he should come
to Longbourn instead of to Lucas Lodge; it was also very inconvenient
and exceedingly troublesome. She hated having visitors in the house
while her health was so indifferent, and lovers were of all people the
most disagreeable. Such were the gentle murmurs of Mrs. Bennet, and
they gave way only to the greater distress of Mr. Bingley's continued
absence.

Neither Jane nor Elizabeth were comfortable on this subject. Day after
day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the
report which shortly prevailed in Meryton of his coming no more to
Netherfield the whole winter; a report which highly incensed Mrs.
Bennet, and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous
falsehood.

Even Elizabeth began to fear--not that Bingley was indifferent--but that
his sisters would be successful in keeping him away. Unwilling as
she was to admit an idea so destructive of Jane's happiness, and so
dishonorable to the stability of her lover, she could not prevent its
frequently occurring. The united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters
and of his overpowering friend, assisted by the attractions of Miss
Darcy and the amusements of London might be too much, she feared, for
the strength of his attachment.

As for Jane, _her_ anxiety under this suspense was, of course, more
painful than Elizabeth's, but whatever she felt she was desirous of
concealing, and between herself and Elizabeth, therefore, the subject
was never alluded to. But as no such delicacy restrained her mother,
an hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of Bingley, express her
impatience for his arrival, or even require Jane to confess that if he
did not come back she would think herself very ill used. It needed
all Jane's steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable
tranquillity.

Mr. Collins returned most punctually on Monday fortnight, but his
reception at Longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his
first introduction. He was too happy, however, to need much attention;
and luckily for the others, the business of love-making relieved them
from a great deal of his company. The chief of every day was spent by
him at Lucas Lodge, and he sometimes returned to Longbourn only in time
to make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed.

Mrs. Bennet was really in a most pitiable state. The very mention of
anything concerning the match threw her into an agony of ill-humour,
and wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of. The sight
of Miss Lucas was odious to her. As her successor in that house, she
regarded her with jealous abhorrence. Whenever Charlotte came to see
them, she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession; and
whenever she spoke in a low voice to Mr. Collins, was convinced that
they were talking of the Longbourn estate, and resolving to turn herself
and her daughters out of the house, as soon as Mr. Bennet were dead. She
complained bitterly of all this to her husband.

“, bennet,” said she, “its ultra hard to think that charlotte
lucas should ever be mistress of this house, that i should be forced to
make way for _her_, and live to see her take her place in it!”

“my homie, do not give way to such gloomy thoughts. let us hope for
better things. let us flatter ourselves that i may be the survivor :)”

This was not very consoling to Mrs. Bennet, and therefore, instead of
making any answer, she went on as before.

“i cant bear to think that they all this estate. if it was
not for the entail, i should not mind it.”

“what should not you mind?”

“i should not mind anything at all.”

“let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such
insensibility.”

“lol i cant be thankful, bennet, for anything about the entail. how
anyone could have the conscience to entail away an estate from one's own
daughters, i cant understand; and all for the sake of collins too!
why should _he_ have it more than anybody else?”

“i leave it to yourself to determine,” said Mr. Bennet.



Chapter 24


Miss Bingley's letter arrived, and put an end to doubt. The very first
sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in London for
the winter, and concluded with her brother's regret at not having had
time to pay his respects to his friends in Hertfordshire before he left
the country.

Hope was over, entirely over; and when Jane could attend to the rest
of the letter, she found little, except the professed affection of the
writer, that could give her any comfort. Miss Darcy's praise occupied
the chief of it. Her many attractions were again dwelt on, and Caroline
boasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy, and ventured to predict
the accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former
letter. She wrote also with great pleasure of her brother's being an
inmate of Mr. Darcy's house, and mentioned with raptures some plans of
the latter with regard to new furniture.

Elizabeth, to whom Jane very soon communicated the chief of all this,
heard it in silent indignation. Her heart was divided between concern
for her sister, and resentment against all others. To Caroline's
assertion of her brother's being partial to Miss Darcy she paid no
credit. That he was really fond of Jane, she doubted no more than she
had ever done; and much as she had always been disposed to like him, she
could not think without anger, hardly without contempt, on that easiness
of temper, that want of proper resolution, which now made him the slave
of his designing friends, and led him to sacrifice of his own happiness
to the caprice of their inclination. Had his own happiness, however,
been the only sacrifice, he might have been allowed to sport with it in
whatever manner he thought best, but her sister's was involved in it, as
she thought he must be sensible himself. It was a subject, in short,
on which reflection would be long indulged, and must be unavailing. She
could think of nothing else; and yet whether Bingley's regard had really
died away, or were suppressed by his friends' interference; whether
he had been aware of Jane's attachment, or whether it had escaped his
observation; whatever were the case, though her opinion of him must be
materially affected by the difference, her sister's situation remained
the same, her peace equally wounded.

A day or two passed before Jane had courage to speak of her feelings to
Elizabeth; but at last, on Mrs. Bennet's leaving them together, after a
longer irritation than usual about Netherfield and its master, she could
not help saying:

“whaaaaat, that my homie mom had more command over herself! she can have no
idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him. but
i will not repine. it cant last long. he will be forgot, and well
all be as we were before.”

Elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude, but said
nothing.

“you doubt me ;_;” cried Jane, slightly colouring; “, youve
no reason. he may live in my memory as the craziest friendly guy of my
acquaintance, but thats all. i dont havehing either to hope or fear,
and nothing to reproach him with. thank god! i dont have _that_ pain. a
little time, therefore--i will totes try to get the better.”

With a stronger voice she soon added, “i have this comfort immediately,
that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side, and that it
has done no harm to anyone but me.”

“my homie jane w00t!” exclaimed Elizabeth, “you are too good. your sweetness
and disinterestedness are really angelic; i do not know what to say
to you. i feel as if i had never done you justice, or loved you as you
deserve.”

Miss Bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit, and threw back
the praise on her sister's warm affection.

“nay,” said Elizabeth, “this aint fair. _you_ wish to think all the
world respectable, and are hurt if i speak sick of anybody. i only want
to think _you_ perfect, and you set yourself against it. do not
be afraid of my running into any excess, of my encroaching on your
privilege of universal good-will. you need not. there are few people
who i really love, and stil fewer of who i think well. the more i see
of the world, the more am i dissatisfied with it; and every day confirms
my belief of the inconsistency of all human personalitys, and of the
little dependence that can be placed on the looks of merit or
sense. i have met with two instances lately, one i will not mention; the
other is charlotte's marriage. its unaccountable! in every view its
unaccountable!”

“my homie lizzy, do not give way to such feels as these. they will
ruin your happiness. you do not make allowance enough for difference
of situation and temper. consider collins's respectability, and
charlotte's steady, prudent personality. remember that shes one of a
large fam; that as to fortune, its a craziest eligible match; and be
ready to believe, for errbody's sake, that she may feel something like
regard and esteem for our cuz.”

“to oblige you, i would try to believe almost anything, but no one else
could be benefited by such a belief as this; for were i persuaded that
charlotte had any regard for him, i should only think worse of her
understanding than i now do of her heart. my homie jane, collins is a
conceited, pompous, narrow-minded, silly man; you know he is, as well as
i do; and you must feel, as well as i do, that the woman who attached him
cant have a proper way of thinking. youll not defend her, though
its charlotte lucas. youll not, for the sake of one individual,
change the meaning of principle and integrity, nor try to persuade
yourself or me, that selfishness is prudence, and insensibility of
danger security for happiness.”

“i think your language too strong in speaking of both,” replied
Jane; “and i hope youll be convinced by seeing them happy
together. but enough of this. you alluded to something else. you
mentioned _two_ instances. i cant misunderstand you, but i entreat
you, dear lizzy, not to pain me by thinking _that person_ to blame, and
saying your opinion of him is sunk. we must not be so ready to fancy
ourselves intentionally injured. we must not expect a fun fuccboi
to be always so guarded and circumspect. its ultra often nothing but
our own vanity that deceives us. women fancy admiration means more than
it does.”

“and dudes take care that they should :)”

“if its goaledly done, they cant be justified; but i have no idea
of there being so much goal in the world as some persons imagine.”

“im far from attributing any part of bingley's conduct to goal,”
 said Elizabeth; “but without scheming to do wrong, or to make others
unhappy, there may be error, and there may be misery. thoughtlessness,
want of attention to other people's feels, and want of resolution,
will do the business -.-”

“and do you impute it to either of those?”

“yeah; to the last. but if i go on, i will displease you by saying what
i think of persons you esteem. stop me whilst you can.”

“you persist, then, in supposing his sisters influence him?”

“yeah, in conjunction with his friend.”

“i cant believe it. why should they try to influence him? they can
only wish his happiness; and if he is attached to me, no other woman can
secure it.”

“your first position is false. they may wish many things besides his
happiness; they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence; they
may wish him to hook up with a girl whos all the importance of money, great
connections, and ego :)”

“beyond a doubt, they _do_ wish him to choose darcy -.-” replied Jane;
“but this may be from better feels than you are supposing. they have
known her much longer than they have known me; no wonder if they love
her better. but, whatever may be their own wishes, its ultra unlikely
they opposed their bro's. what sis would think
herself at liberty to do it, unless there were something very
objectionable? if they believed him attached to me, they wouldnt try
to part us; if he were so, they couldnt succeed. by supposing such an
affection, you make errbody acting unnaturally and wrong, and me most
unhappy. do not distress me by the idea. im not ashamed of having been
wrong--or, at least, its light, its nothing in comparison of what
i should feel in thinking sick of him or his sisters. let me take it in
the best light, in the light in which it may be understood.”

Elizabeth could not oppose such a wish; and from this time Mr. Bingley's
name was scarcely ever mentioned between them.

Mrs. Bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no
more, and though a day seldom passed in which Elizabeth did not account
for it clearly, there was little chance of her ever considering it with
less perplexity. Her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what she
did not believe herself, that his attentions to Jane had been merely the
effect of a common and transient liking, which ceased when he saw her
no more; but though the probability of the statement was admitted at
the time, she had the same story to repeat every day. Mrs. Bennet's best
comfort was that Mr. Bingley must be down again in the summer.

Mr. Bennet treated the matter differently. “so, lizzy,” said he one day,
“your sis is crossed in love, i find. i congratulate her. next to
being attached, a girl likes to be crossed a little in lovee now then.
its something to think of, and it gives her a sort of distinction
among her companions. when is your turn to come? youll barely bear to
be long outdone by jane. now is your time. here are officers enough in
meryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country. let wickham
be _your_ man. he is a pleasant fellow, and would jilt you creditably.”

“thank you, fam, but a less agreeable guy would satisfy me. we must not
all expect jane's good fortune :)”

“true,” said Mr. Bennet, “but its a comfort to think that whatever of
that kind may happen to you, youve an nice mom who will make
the craziest :)”

Mr. Wickham's society was of material service in dispelling the gloom
which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the Longbourn
family. They saw him often, and to his other recommendations was now
added that of general unreserve. The whole of what Elizabeth had already
heard, his claims on Mr. Darcy, and all that he had suffered from him,
was now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed; and everybody was
pleased to know how much they had always disliked Mr. Darcy before they
had known anything of the matter.

Miss Bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be
any extenuating circumstances in the case, unknown to the society
of Hertfordshire; her mild and steady candour always pleaded for
allowances, and urged the possibility of mistakes--but by everybody else
Mr. Darcy was condemned as the worst of men.



Chapter 25


After a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity,
Mr. Collins was called from his amiable Charlotte by the arrival of
Saturday. The pain of separation, however, might be alleviated on his
side, by preparations for the reception of his bride; as he had reason
to hope, that shortly after his return into Hertfordshire, the day would
be fixed that was to make him the happiest of men. He took leave of his
relations at Longbourn with as much solemnity as before; wished his fair
cousins health and happiness again, and promised their father another
letter of thanks.

On the following Monday, Mrs. Bennet had the pleasure of receiving
her brother and his wife, who came as usual to spend the Christmas
at Longbourn. Mr. Gardiner was a sensible, gentlemanlike man, greatly
superior to his sister, as well by nature as education. The Netherfield
ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived
by trade, and within view of his own warehouses, could have been so
well-bred and agreeable. Mrs. Gardiner, who was several years younger
than Mrs. Bennet and Mrs. Phillips, was an amiable, intelligent, elegant
woman, and a great favourite with all her Longbourn nieces. Between the
two eldest and herself especially, there subsisted a particular regard.
They had frequently been staying with her in town.

The first part of Mrs. Gardiner's business on her arrival was to
distribute her presents and describe the newest fashions. When this was
done she had a less active part to play. It became her turn to listen.
Mrs. Bennet had many grievances to relate, and much to complain of. They
had all been very ill-used since she last saw her sister. Two of her
girls had been upon the point of marriage, and after all there was
nothing in it.

“i do not blame jane :)” she continued, “for jane wouldve got 
bingley if she could. but lizzy! whaaaaat, sister! its ultra hard to think
that she might have been collins's wife by this time, had it not
been for her own perverseness. he made her an offer in this ultra room,
and she refused him. the consequence is, that lucas will have
a daughter attached before i have, and that the longbourn estate is just
as much entailed as ever. the lucases are ultra artful people ,
sister. they are all for what they can get. im sorry to say it of
them, but so its. it makes me ultra nervous and poorly, to be thwarted
so in my own fam, and to have neighbours who think of themselves
before anybody else. however, your comin just at this time is the
greatest of comforts, and im ultra happpy to hear what you tell us, of
long sleeves.”

Mrs. Gardiner, to whom the chief of this news had been given before,
in the course of Jane and Elizabeth's correspondence with her, made her
sister a slight answer, and, in compassion to her nieces, turned the
conversation.

When alone with Elizabeth afterwards, she spoke more on the subject. “it
seems likely to have been a defamable match for jane,” said she. “im
sorry it went off. but these things happen so often! a fuccboi, such
as you describe bingley, so easily falls in lovee with a pretty girl
for a few weeks, and when accident separates them, so easily forgets
her, that these sort of inconsistencies are ultra frequent :)”

“an excellent consolation in its way :)” said Elizabeth, “but it will not
do for _us_. we do not suffer by _accident_. it does not often
happen that the interference of friends will persuade a fuccboi of
independent fortune to think no more of a girl who he was violently in
love with only a few days before.”

“but that expression of 'violently in love' is so hackneyed, so
doubtful, so indefinite, that it gives me ultra little idea. its as
often applied to feels which arise from a half-hour's acquaintance,
as to a real, strong attachment. pray, how _violent was_ bingley's
love?”

“i never saw a more promising inclination; he was growing super
inattentive to other people, and wholly engrossed by her. every time
they met, it was more decided and remarkable. at his own ball he
offended two or three young ladies, by not asking them to dance; and i
spoke to him twice me, without receiving an answer. could there be
finer symptoms? aint general incivility the ultra essence of love?”

“whaaaaat, yeah!--of that kind of lovee which i suppose him to have felt. poor
jane! im sorry for her, because, with her personality, she may not get
over it immediately. it oughta have happened to _you_, lizzy; you
wouldve laughed yourself out sooner. but do you think she
would be prevailed upon to go back with us? change of scene might be
of service--and perhaps a little relief from home may be as useful as
anything.”

Elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal, and felt persuaded
of her sister's ready acquiescence.

“i hope,” added Mrs. Gardiner, “that no consideration with regard to
this fuccboi will influence her. we live in so different a part of
town, all our connections are so different, and, as you well know, we go
out so little, that its ultra not gonna happen that they should meet at all,
unless he really comes to see her.”

“and _that_ is super impossible; for he is now in the custody of his
friend, and darcy would no more suffer him to call on jane in such
a part of london! my homie aunt, how could you think ? darcy may
perhaps have _heard_ of such a place as gracechurch street, but he
would barely think a month's ablution enough to cleanse him from its
impurities, were he once to enter it; and depend upon it, bingley
never stirs without him.”

“so much the better. i hope they will not meet at all. but does not jane
correspond with his sister? _she_ will not be able to help calling.”

“she will drop the acquaintance entirely -.-”

But in spite of the certainty in which Elizabeth affected to place this
point, as well as the still more interesting one of Bingley's being
withheld from seeing Jane, she felt a solicitude on the subject which
convinced her, on examination, that she did not consider it entirely
hopeless. It was possible, and sometimes she thought it probable, that
his affection might be reanimated, and the influence of his friends
successfully combated by the more natural influence of Jane's
attractions.

Miss Bennet accepted her aunt's invitation with pleasure; and the
Bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the same time, than as she
hoped by Caroline's not living in the same house with her brother,
she might occasionally spend a morning with her, without any danger of
seeing him.

The Gardiners stayed a week at Longbourn; and what with the Phillipses,
the Lucases, and the officers, there was not a day without its
engagement. Mrs. Bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment
of her brother and sister, that they did not once sit down to a family
dinner. When the engagement was for home, some of the officers always
made part of it--of which officers Mr. Wickham was sure to be one; and
on these occasions, Mrs. Gardiner, rendered suspicious by Elizabeth's
warm commendation, narrowly observed them both. Without supposing them,
from what she saw, to be very seriously in love, their preference
of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy; and
she resolved to speak to Elizabeth on the subject before she left
Hertfordshire, and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such
an attachment.

To Mrs. Gardiner, Wickham had one means of affording pleasure,
unconnected with his general powers. About ten or a dozen years ago,
before her marriage, she had spent a considerable time in that very
part of Derbyshire to which he belonged. They had, therefore, many
acquaintances in common; and though Wickham had been little there since
the death of Darcy's father, it was yet in his power to give her fresher
intelligence of her former friends than she had been in the way of
procuring.

Mrs. Gardiner had seen Pemberley, and known the late Mr. Darcy by
character perfectly well. Here consequently was an inexhaustible subject
of discourse. In comparing her recollection of Pemberley with the minute
description which Wickham could give, and in bestowing her tribute of
praise on the character of its late possessor, she was delighting both
him and herself. On being made acquainted with the present Mr. Darcy's
treatment of him, she tried to remember some of that gentleman's
reputed disposition when quite a lad which might agree with it, and
was confident at last that she recollected having heard Mr. Fitzwilliam
Darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud, ill-natured boy.



Chapter 26


Mrs. Gardiner's caution to Elizabeth was punctually and kindly given
on the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone; after
honestly telling her what she thought, she thus went on:

“you are too sensible a girl, lizzy, to fall in lovee merely because
you are warned against it; and, therefore, im not afraid of speaking
openly. seriously, i wouldve you be on your guard. do not involve
yourself or try to involve him in an luvwhich the want
of fortune would make so ultra imprudent. i dont havehing to say against
_him_; he is a craziest interesting fuccboi; and if he had the fortune he
should have, i should think you couldnt do better. but as its, you
must not let your fancy run away with you. youve sense, and we all
expect you to use it. your dad would depend on _your_ resolution and
good conduct, im sure. you must not disappoint your dad.”

“my homie aunt, this is being serious :)”

“yeah, and i hope to engage you to be serious likewise :)”

“well, then, you need not be under any alarm. i will take care of
me, and of wickham too. he will not be in lovee with me, if i
can prevent it.”

“elizabeth, you are not serious now.”

“i beg your pls, i will try again. at present im not in lovee with
 wickham; no, i totes am not. but he is, beyond all comparison,
the craziest agreeable guy i ever saw--and if he becomes really attached to
me--i believe it will be better that he should not. i see the craziness
. omg!! _that_ abominable darcy! my dad's opinion of me does
me the greatest honor, and i should be miserable to forfeit it. my
dad is partial to wickham. in short, my homie aunt, i
should be ultra sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy; but
since we see every day that where there is affection, young people
are seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune from entering into
engagements with each other, how can i promise to be wiser than so many
of my fellow-creatures if im tempted, or how am i even to know that it
would be wisdom to resist? all that i can promise you, therefore, is not
to be in a hurry. i will not be in a hurry to believe me his first
object. when im in company with him, i will not be wishing. in short,
i will do my best.”

“perhaps it will be as well if you discourage his comin here so very
often. at least, you should not _remind_ your mom of inviting him.”

“as i did the other day,” said Elizabeth with a conscious smile: “very
true, it will be wise in me to refrain from _that_. but do not imagine
that he is always here so often. its on your account that hes been
so frequently invited this week. you know my mom's ideas as to the
necessity of constant company for her friends. but really, and upon my
honor, i will try to do what i think to be the wisest; and now i hope
you are satisfied.”

Her aunt assured her that she was, and Elizabeth having thanked her for
the kindness of her hints, they parted; a wonderful instance of advice
being given on such a point, without being resented.

Mr. Collins returned into Hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted
by the Gardiners and Jane; but as he took up his abode with the Lucases,
his arrival was no great inconvenience to Mrs. Bennet. His marriage was
now fast approaching, and she was at length so far resigned as to think
it inevitable, and even repeatedly to say, in an ill-natured tone, that
she “_wished_ they might be happy.” Thursday was to be the wedding day,
and on Wednesday Miss Lucas paid her farewell visit; and when she
rose to take leave, Elizabeth, ashamed of her mother's ungracious and
reluctant good wishes, and sincerely affected herself, accompanied her
out of the room. As they went downstairs together, Charlotte said:

“i will depend on hearing from you ultra often, eliza.”

“_that_ you totes will :)”

“and i have another favour to ask you. will you come and see me?”

“well often meet, i hope, in hertfordshire :)”

“im not likely to leave kent for some time. promise me, therefore, to
come to hunsford.”

Elizabeth could not refuse, though she foresaw little pleasure in the
visit.

“my dad and maria are comin to me in march,” added Charlotte, “and i
hope youll consent to be of the party. , eliza, youll be as
welcome as either of them :)”

The wedding took place; the bride and bridegroom set off for Kent from
the church door, and everybody had as much to say, or to hear, on
the subject as usual. Elizabeth soon heard from her friend; and their
correspondence was as regular and frequent as it had ever been; that
it should be equally unreserved was impossible. Elizabeth could never
address her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over,
and though determined not to slacken as a correspondent, it was for the
sake of what had been, rather than what was. Charlotte's first letters
were received with a good deal of eagerness; there could not but be
curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home, how she would
like Lady Catherine, and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to
be; though, when the letters were read, Elizabeth felt that Charlotte
expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen. She
wrote cheerfully, seemed surrounded with comforts, and mentioned nothing
which she could not praise. The house, furniture, neighbourhood, and
roads, were all to her taste, and Lady Catherine's behaviour was most
friendly and obliging. It was Mr. Collins's picture of Hunsford and
Rosings rationally softened; and Elizabeth perceived that she must wait
for her own visit there to know the rest.

Jane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce their
safe arrival in London; and when she wrote again, Elizabeth hoped it
would be in her power to say something of the Bingleys.

Her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience
generally is. Jane had been a week in town without either seeing or
hearing from Caroline. She accounted for it, however, by supposing that
her last letter to her friend from Longbourn had by some accident been
lost.

“my aunt,” she continued, “is going tomorrow into that part of the
town, and i will take the opportunity of calling in grosvenor street.”

She wrote again when the visit was paid, and she had seen Miss Bingley.
“i did not think caroline in spirits,” were her words, “but she was very
happpy to see me, and reproached me for giving her no notice of my comin
to london. i was right, therefore, my last PM had never reached
her. i inquired after their bro, of course. he was well, but so much
hookin up on the regs with darcy that they barely ever saw him. i found that
miss darcy was expected to dinner. i wish i could see her. my visit was
not long, as caroline and that chick hurst were going out. i guess i will
see them soon here.”

Elizabeth shook her head over this letter. It convinced her that
accident only could discover to Mr. Bingley her sister's being in town.

Four weeks passed away, and Jane saw nothing of him. She endeavoured to
persuade herself that she did not regret it; but she could no longer be
blind to Miss Bingley's inattention. After waiting at home every morning
for a fortnight, and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her, the
visitor did at last appear; but the shortness of her stay, and yet more,
the alteration of her manner would allow Jane to deceive herself no
longer. The letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister will
prove what she felt.

“my homieest lizzy will, im sure, be incapable of triumphing in her
better judgement, at my expense, when i admit me to have been
entirely deceived in bingley's regard for me. but, my homie sister,
though the event has proved you right, do not think me obstinate if i
stil assert that, considering what her behavior was, my confidence was
as natural as your suspicion. i do not at all understand her reason for
wishing to be intimate with me; but if the same circumstances were to
happen again, im sure i should be deceived again. caroline did not
return my visit til yeahterday; and not a note, not a line, did i
receive in the meantime. when she did come, it was ultra evident that
she had no pleasure in it; she made a slight, formal apology, for not
calling before, said not a word of wishing to see me again, and was
in every respect so altered a creature, that when she went away i was
just resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer. i pity,
though i cant help blaming her. she was ultra wrong in singling me out
as she did; i can safely say that every advance to intimacy began on
her side. but i pity her, because she must feel that shes been acting
wrong, and because im ultra sure that anxiety for her bro is the
cause . i need not explain me farther; and though _we_ know
this anxiety to be super needless, yet if she feels it, it will easily
account for her behavior to me; and so deservedly dear as he will
his sister, whatever anxiety she must feel on his behalf is natural and
friendly. i cant but care about her having any such fears now,
because, if he had at all cared about me, we must have met, long ago.
he knows of my being in town, im certain, from something she said
herself; and yet itd seem, by her way of talking, as if she
wanted to persuade herself that he is really partial to darcy. i
cant understand it. if i were not afraid of judging harshly, i should
be almost tempted to say that there is a strong looks of duplicity
in all this. but i will try to banish every painful thought,
and think only of whatll make me happy--your affection, and the
invariable kindness of my homie uncle and aunt. let me hear from you very
soon. bingley said something of his never returning to netherfield
again, of giving up the house, but not with any certainty. we oughta
not mention it. im extremely happpy that youve such pleasant accounts
from our friends at hunsford. pray go to see them, with fam william and
maria. im sure youll be ultra comfortable there.--yours, etc.”

This letter gave Elizabeth some pain; but her spirits returned as she
considered that Jane would no longer be duped, by the sister at least.
All expectation from the brother was now absolutely over. She would not
even wish for a renewal of his attentions. His character sunk on
every review of it; and as a punishment for him, as well as a possible
advantage to Jane, she seriously hoped he might really soon marry Mr.
Darcy's sister, as by Wickham's account, she would make him abundantly
regret what he had thrown away.

Mrs. Gardiner about this time reminded Elizabeth of her promise
concerning that gentleman, and required information; and Elizabeth
had such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to
herself. His apparent partiality had subsided, his attentions were over,
he was the admirer of some one else. Elizabeth was watchful enough to
see it all, but she could see it and write of it without material pain.
Her heart had been but slightly touched, and her vanity was satisfied
with believing that _she_ would have been his only choice, had fortune
permitted it. The sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most
remarkable charm of the young lady to whom he was now rendering himself
agreeable; but Elizabeth, less clear-sighted perhaps in this case than
in Charlotte's, did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence.
Nothing, on the contrary, could be more natural; and while able to
suppose that it cost him a few struggles to relinquish her, she was
ready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both, and could very
sincerely wish him happy.

All this was acknowledged to Mrs. Gardiner; and after relating the
circumstances, she thus went on: “im now convinced, my homie aunt, that
i have never been much in love; for had i really experienced that pure
and elevating passion, i should at present hate his ultra name, and
wish him all way of evil. but my feels are not only cordial
towards _him_; they are even impartial towards king. i cant find
out that i hate her at all, or that im in the least unwilling to
think her a ultra good sort of girl. there can be no lovee in all this. my
watchfulness has been effectual; and though i totes should be a more
interesting object to all my acquaintances were i distractedly in love
with him, i cant say that i regret my comparative insignificance.
importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly. kitty and lydia take
his defection much more to heart than i do. they are young in the
ways of the world, and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that
hottt young dudes must have something to live on as well as the plain.”



Chapter 27


With no greater events than these in the Longbourn family, and otherwise
diversified by little beyond the walks to Meryton, sometimes dirty and
sometimes cold, did January and February pass away. March was to take
Elizabeth to Hunsford. She had not at first thought very seriously of
going thither; but Charlotte, she soon found, was depending on the plan
and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure
as well as greater certainty. Absence had increased her desire of seeing
Charlotte again, and weakened her disgust of Mr. Collins. There
was novelty in the scheme, and as, with such a mother and such
uncompanionable sisters, home could not be faultless, a little change
was not unwelcome for its own sake. The journey would moreover give her
a peep at Jane; and, in short, as the time drew near, she would have
been very sorry for any delay. Everything, however, went on smoothly,
and was finally settled according to Charlotte's first sketch. She was
to accompany Sir William and his second daughter. The improvement
of spending a night in London was added in time, and the plan became
perfect as plan could be.

The only pain was in leaving her father, who would certainly miss her,
and who, when it came to the point, so little liked her going, that he
told her to write to him, and almost promised to answer her letter.

The farewell between herself and Mr. Wickham was perfectly friendly; on
his side even more. His present pursuit could not make him forget that
Elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention, the
first to listen and to pity, the first to be admired; and in his manner
of bidding her adieu, wishing her every enjoyment, reminding her of
what she was to expect in Lady Catherine de Bourgh, and trusting their
opinion of her--their opinion of everybody--would always coincide, there
was a solicitude, an interest which she felt must ever attach her to
him with a most sincere regard; and she parted from him convinced that,
whether married or single, he must always be her model of the amiable
and pleasing.

Her fellow-travellers the next day were not of a kind to make her
think him less agreeable. Sir William Lucas, and his daughter Maria, a
good-humoured girl, but as empty-headed as himself, had nothing to say
that could be worth hearing, and were listened to with about as much
delight as the rattle of the chaise. Elizabeth loved absurdities, but
she had known Sir William's too long. He could tell her nothing new of
the wonders of his presentation and knighthood; and his civilities were
worn out, like his information.

It was a journey of only twenty-four miles, and they began it so early
as to be in Gracechurch Street by noon. As they drove to Mr. Gardiner's
door, Jane was at a drawing-room window watching their arrival; when
they entered the passage she was there to welcome them, and Elizabeth,
looking earnestly in her face, was pleased to see it healthful and
lovely as ever. On the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls,
whose eagerness for their cousin's appearance would not allow them to
wait in the drawing-room, and whose shyness, as they had not seen
her for a twelvemonth, prevented their coming lower. All was joy and
kindness. The day passed most pleasantly away; the morning in bustle and
shopping, and the evening at one of the theatres.

Elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt. Their first object was her
sister; and she was more grieved than astonished to hear, in reply to
her minute inquiries, that though Jane always struggled to support her
spirits, there were periods of dejection. It was reasonable, however,
to hope that they would not continue long. Mrs. Gardiner gave her the
particulars also of Miss Bingley's visit in Gracechurch Street, and
repeated conversations occurring at different times between Jane and
herself, which proved that the former had, from her heart, given up the
acquaintance.

Mrs. Gardiner then rallied her niece on Wickham's desertion, and
complimented her on bearing it so well.

“but my homie elizabeth :)” she added, “what sort of girl is king? i
should be sorry to think our friend mercenary.”

“pray, my homie aunt, what is the difference in matrimonial affairs,
between the mercenary and the prudent motive? where does discretion end,
and avarice begin? last christmas you were afraid of his getting me,
because itd be imprudent; and now, because he is trying to get
a girl with only ten thousand pounds, you want to find out that he is
mercenary lol”

“lol if youll only tell me what sort of girl king is, i will know
what to think.”

“shes a ultra good kind of girl, i believe. i know no harm of her -.-”

“but he paid her not the smallest attention til her granddad's death
made her mistress of this fortune.”

“no--why should he? if it were not allowable for him to gain _my_
affections because i had no money, what occasion could there be for
making lovee to a girl who he did not care about, and who was equally
poor?”

“but there seems an indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her
so soon after this event.”

“a guy in shook circumstances has not time for all those elegant
decorums which other people may observe. if _she_ does not object to it,
why should _we_?”

“_her_ not objecting does not justify _him_. it only shows her being
deficient in something herself--sense or feeling.”

“well,” cried Elizabeth, “have it as you choose. _he_ will be
mercenary, and _she_ will be foolish.”

“no, lizzy, thats what i do _not_ choose. i should be sorry, you know,
to think sick of a fuccboi whos lived so long in derbyshire.”

“omg!! if thats all, i have a ultra poor opinion of young dudes who live in
derbyshire; and their intimate friends who live in hertfordshire are not
much better. im sick of them all. thank heaven! im going tomorrow
where i will find a guy whos not one agreeable quality, whos
neither way nor sense to recommend him. stupid dudes are the only ones
worth knowing, after all -.-”

“take care, lizzy; that speech savours strongly of disappointment :)”

Before they were separated by the conclusion of the play, she had the
unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle and aunt in
a tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summer.

“we have not determined how far it will carry us,” said Mrs. Gardiner,
“but, perhaps, to the lakes.”

No scheme could have been more agreeable to Elizabeth, and her
acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful. “whaaaaat, my homie,
dear aunt w00t! ^.^” she rapturously cried, “what delight! what felicity! you
give me fresh life and vigour. adieu to disappointment and spleen. what
are young dudes to rocks and mountains? omg!! what hours of transport
well spend! and when we _do_ return, it will not be like other
travellers, without being able to give one accurate idea of anything. we
_will_ know where we have gone--we _will_ recollect what we have seen.
lakes, mountains, and rivers will not be jumbled together in our
imaginations; nor when we attempt to describe any particular scene,
will we begin quarreling about its relative situation. let _our_
first effusions be less insupportable than those of the generality of
travellers.”



Chapter 28


Every object in the next day's journey was new and interesting to
Elizabeth; and her spirits were in a state of enjoyment; for she had
seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health,
and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight.

When they left the high road for the lane to Hunsford, every eye was in
search of the Parsonage, and every turning expected to bring it in view.
The palings of Rosings Park was their boundary on one side. Elizabeth
smiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants.

At length the Parsonage was discernible. The garden sloping to the
road, the house standing in it, the green pales, and the laurel hedge,
everything declared they were arriving. Mr. Collins and Charlotte
appeared at the door, and the carriage stopped at the small gate which
led by a short gravel walk to the house, amidst the nods and smiles of
the whole party. In a moment they were all out of the chaise, rejoicing
at the sight of each other. Mrs. Collins welcomed her friend with the
liveliest pleasure, and Elizabeth was more and more satisfied with
coming when she found herself so affectionately received. She saw
instantly that her cousin's manners were not altered by his marriage;
his formal civility was just what it had been, and he detained her some
minutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his inquiries after all her
family. They were then, with no other delay than his pointing out the
neatness of the entrance, taken into the house; and as soon as they
were in the parlour, he welcomed them a second time, with ostentatious
formality to his humble abode, and punctually repeated all his wife's
offers of refreshment.

Elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory; and she could not help
in fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room, its
aspect and its furniture, he addressed himself particularly to her,
as if wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him. But
though everything seemed neat and comfortable, she was not able to
gratify him by any sigh of repentance, and rather looked with wonder at
her friend that she could have so cheerful an air with such a companion.
When Mr. Collins said anything of which his wife might reasonably be
ashamed, which certainly was not unseldom, she involuntarily turned her
eye on Charlotte. Once or twice she could discern a faint blush; but
in general Charlotte wisely did not hear. After sitting long enough to
admire every article of furniture in the room, from the sideboard to
the fender, to give an account of their journey, and of all that had
happened in London, Mr. Collins invited them to take a stroll in the
garden, which was large and well laid out, and to the cultivation of
which he attended himself. To work in this garden was one of his most
respectable pleasures; and Elizabeth admired the command of countenance
with which Charlotte talked of the healthfulness of the exercise, and
owned she encouraged it as much as possible. Here, leading the way
through every walk and cross walk, and scarcely allowing them an
interval to utter the praises he asked for, every view was pointed out
with a minuteness which left beauty entirely behind. He could number the
fields in every direction, and could tell how many trees there were in
the most distant clump. But of all the views which his garden, or which
the country or kingdom could boast, none were to be compared with the
prospect of Rosings, afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered
the park nearly opposite the front of his house. It was a handsome
modern building, well situated on rising ground.

From his garden, Mr. Collins would have led them round his two meadows;
but the ladies, not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white
frost, turned back; and while Sir William accompanied him, Charlotte
took her sister and friend over the house, extremely well pleased,
probably, to have the opportunity of showing it without her husband's
help. It was rather small, but well built and convenient; and everything
was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency of which
Elizabeth gave Charlotte all the credit. When Mr. Collins could be
forgotten, there was really an air of great comfort throughout, and by
Charlotte's evident enjoyment of it, Elizabeth supposed he must be often
forgotten.

She had already learnt that Lady Catherine was still in the country. It
was spoken of again while they were at dinner, when Mr. Collins joining
in, observed:

“yeah, elizabeth, youll have the honor of seeing catherine
de bourgh on the ensuing sunday at church, and i need not say youll
be happy with her. shes all affability and throwin shade, and i
doubt not but youll be honored with some portion of her notice
when service is over. i have barely any hesitation in saying she
will include you and my sis maria in every msg with which she
honors us during your stay here. her behavior to my homie charlotte is
charming. we dine at rosings twice every week, and are never allowed
to walk home. that bitch's ride is regularly ordered for us. i
_should_ say, one of that bitch's rides, for shes several.”

“ catherine is a ultra respectable, sensible woman :)” added
Charlotte, “and a craziest attentive neighbour.”

“very true, my homie, thats right only what i say. shes the sort of
woman who one cant regard with too much deference.”

The evening was spent chiefly in talking over Hertfordshire news,
and telling again what had already been written; and when it closed,
Elizabeth, in the solitude of her chamber, had to meditate upon
Charlotte's degree of contentment, to understand her address in guiding,
and composure in bearing with, her husband, and to acknowledge that it
was all done very well. She had also to anticipate how her visit
would pass, the quiet tenor of their usual employments, the vexatious
interruptions of Mr. Collins, and the gaieties of their intercourse with
Rosings. A lively imagination soon settled it all.

About the middle of the next day, as she was in her room getting ready
for a walk, a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in
confusion; and, after listening a moment, she heard somebody running
up stairs in a violent hurry, and calling loudly after her. She opened
the door and met Maria in the landing place, who, breathless with
agitation, cried out--

“whaaaaat, my homie eliza! pray make haste and come into the dining-room, for
there is such a sight to be seen! i will not tell you what its. make
haste, and come down this moment.”

Elizabeth asked questions in vain; Maria would tell her nothing more,
and down they ran into the dining-room, which fronted the lane, in
quest of this wonder; It was two ladies stopping in a low phaeton at the
garden gate.

“and is this all?” cried Elizabeth. “i expected at least that the pigs
were got into the garden, and here is nothing but catherine and her
daughter.”

“la! my homie,” said Maria, quite shocked at the mistake, “its not
 catherine. the old is that chick jenkinson, who lives with them;
the other is de bourgh. only look at her. shes super a little
creature. who wouldve thought that she could be so thin and small?”

“shes abominably rude to keep charlotte out of doors in all this wind.
why does she not come in?”

“whaaaaat, charlotte says she barely ever does. its the greatest of favours
when de bourgh comes in :)”

“i like her looks :)” said Elizabeth, struck with other ideas. “she
looks sickly and cross. yeah, she will do for him ultra well. she will
make him a ultra proper wife.”

Mr. Collins and Charlotte were both standing at the gate in conversation
with the ladies; and Sir William, to Elizabeth's high diversion, was
stationed in the doorway, in earnest contemplation of the greatness
before him, and constantly bowing whenever Miss de Bourgh looked that
way.

At length there was nothing more to be said; the ladies drove on, and
the others returned into the house. Mr. Collins no sooner saw the two
girls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune, which
Charlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party was asked
to dine at Rosings the next day.



Chapter 29


Mr. Collins's triumph, in consequence of this invitation, was complete.
The power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering
visitors, and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his
wife, was exactly what he had wished for; and that an opportunity
of doing it should be given so soon, was such an instance of Lady
Catherine's condescension, as he knew not how to admire enough.

“i admit,” said he, “that i should not have been at all surprised by
that bitch's asking us on sunday to drink tea and spend the night at
rosings. i kinda expected, from my knowledge of her affability, that it
would happen. but who could have foreseen such an attention as this? who
could have imagined that we should receive an msg to dine there
(an msg, moreover, including the whole party) so immediately
after your visit!”

“im the less surprised at what has happened,” replied Sir William,
“from that knowledge of what the ways of the great really are, which
my situation in life has allowed me to acquire. about the court, such
instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon.”

Scarcely anything was talked of the whole day or next morning but their
visit to Rosings. Mr. Collins was carefully instructing them in what
they were to expect, that the sight of such rooms, so many servants, and
so splendid a dinner, might not wholly overpower them.

When the ladies were separating for the toilette, he said to Elizabeth--

“do not make yourself uneasy, my homie cuz, about your apparel. 
catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us which
becomes herself and her daughter. i would advise you merely to put on
whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest--there is no occasion
for anything more. catherine will not think the worse of you
for being simply dressed. she likes to have the distinction of rank
preserved.”

While they were dressing, he came two or three times to their different
doors, to recommend their being quick, as Lady Catherine very much
objected to be kept waiting for her dinner. Such formidable accounts of
her ladyship, and her manner of living, quite frightened Maria Lucas
who had been little used to company, and she looked forward to her
introduction at Rosings with as much apprehension as her father had done
to his presentation at St. James's.

As the weather was fine, they had a pleasant walk of about half a
mile across the park. Every park has its beauty and its prospects; and
Elizabeth saw much to be pleased with, though she could not be in such
raptures as Mr. Collins expected the scene to inspire, and was but
slightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the
house, and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally
cost Sir Lewis de Bourgh.

When they ascended the steps to the hall, Maria's alarm was every
moment increasing, and even Sir William did not look perfectly calm.
Elizabeth's courage did not fail her. She had heard nothing of Lady
Catherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents or
miraculous virtue, and the mere stateliness of money or rank she thought
she could witness without trepidation.

From the entrance-hall, of which Mr. Collins pointed out, with a
rapturous air, the fine proportion and the finished ornaments, they
followed the servants through an ante-chamber, to the room where Lady
Catherine, her daughter, and Mrs. Jenkinson were sitting. Her ladyship,
with great condescension, arose to receive them; and as Mrs. Collins had
settled it with her husband that the office of introduction should
be hers, it was performed in a proper manner, without any of those
apologies and thanks which he would have thought necessary.

In spite of having been at St. James's, Sir William was so completely
awed by the grandeur surrounding him, that he had but just courage
enough to make a very low bow, and take his seat without saying a word;
and his daughter, frightened almost out of her senses, sat on the edge
of her chair, not knowing which way to look. Elizabeth found herself
quite equal to the scene, and could observe the three ladies before her
composedly. Lady Catherine was a tall, large woman, with strongly-marked
features, which might once have been handsome. Her air was not
conciliating, nor was her manner of receiving them such as to make her
visitors forget their inferior rank. She was not rendered formidable by
silence; but whatever she said was spoken in so authoritative a tone,
as marked her self-importance, and brought Mr. Wickham immediately to
Elizabeth's mind; and from the observation of the day altogether, she
believed Lady Catherine to be exactly what he represented.

When, after examining the mother, in whose countenance and deportment
she soon found some resemblance of Mr. Darcy, she turned her eyes on the
daughter, she could almost have joined in Maria's astonishment at her
being so thin and so small. There was neither in figure nor face any
likeness between the ladies. Miss de Bourgh was pale and sickly; her
features, though not plain, were insignificant; and she spoke very
little, except in a low voice, to Mrs. Jenkinson, in whose appearance
there was nothing remarkable, and who was entirely engaged in listening
to what she said, and placing a screen in the proper direction before
her eyes.

After sitting a few minutes, they were all sent to one of the windows to
admire the view, Mr. Collins attending them to point out its beauties,
and Lady Catherine kindly informing them that it was much better worth
looking at in the summer.

The dinner was exceedingly handsome, and there were all the servants and
all the articles of plate which Mr. Collins had promised; and, as he had
likewise foretold, he took his seat at the bottom of the table, by her
ladyship's desire, and looked as if he felt that life could furnish
nothing greater. He carved, and ate, and praised with delighted
alacrity; and every dish was commended, first by him and then by Sir
William, who was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son-in-law
said, in a manner which Elizabeth wondered Lady Catherine could bear.
But Lady Catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration, and
gave most gracious smiles, especially when any dish on the table proved
a novelty to them. The party did not supply much conversation. Elizabeth
was ready to speak whenever there was an opening, but she was seated
between Charlotte and Miss de Bourgh--the former of whom was engaged in
listening to Lady Catherine, and the latter said not a word to her all
dinner-time. Mrs. Jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little
Miss de Bourgh ate, pressing her to try some other dish, and fearing
she was indisposed. Maria thought speaking out of the question, and the
gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire.

When the ladies returned to the drawing-room, there was little to
be done but to hear Lady Catherine talk, which she did without any
intermission till coffee came in, delivering her opinion on every
subject in so decisive a manner, as proved that she was not used to
have her judgement controverted. She inquired into Charlotte's domestic
concerns familiarly and minutely, gave her a great deal of advice as
to the management of them all; told her how everything ought to be
regulated in so small a family as hers, and instructed her as to the
care of her cows and her poultry. Elizabeth found that nothing was
beneath this great lady's attention, which could furnish her with an
occasion of dictating to others. In the intervals of her discourse
with Mrs. Collins, she addressed a variety of questions to Maria and
Elizabeth, but especially to the latter, of whose connections she knew
the least, and who she observed to Mrs. Collins was a very genteel,
pretty kind of girl. She asked her, at different times, how many sisters
she had, whether they were older or younger than herself, whether any of
them were likely to be married, whether they were handsome, where they
had been educated, what carriage her father kept, and what had been
her mother's maiden name? Elizabeth felt all the impertinence of
her questions but answered them very composedly. Lady Catherine then
observed,

“your dad's estate is entailed on collins, i think. for your
sake,” turning to Charlotte, “im happpy ; but otherwise i see no
occasion for entailing estates from the female line. it was not thought
necessary in fam lewis de bourgh's fam. do you play and sing, miss
bennet?”

“a little.”

“omg!! then--some time or other well be happy to hear you. our
instrument is a good one, probably superior to----youll try it
some day. do your sisters play and sing :)”

“one of them does.”

“why did not you all learn? you should all to have learned. the miss
webbs all play, and their dad has not so good an income as yours. do
you draw?”

“no, not at all.”

“what, none of you?”

“not one.”

“thats ultra strange. but i suppose you had no opportunity. your mom
 taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters.”

“my mom wouldve had no objection, but my dad hates london ;_;”

“has your governess left you?”

“we never had any governess.”

“no governess! how was that possible? five daughters brought up at home
without a governess! i never heard of such a thing. your mom must
have been super a slave to your education.”

Elizabeth could hardly help smiling as she assured her that had not been
the case.

“then, who taught you? who attended to you? without a governess, you
must have been neglected.”

“compared with some families, i believe we were; but such of us as
wished to learn never wanted the means. we were always encouraged to
read, and had all the masters that were necessary. those who chose to be
idle, totes might.”

“yeah, no doubt; but thats what a governess will prevent, and if i had
known your mom, i advised her craziest strenuously to engage
one. i always say that nothing will be done in education without steady
and regular instruction, and nobody but a governess can give it. its
wonderful how many families i have been the means of supplying in that
way. im always happpy to get a young person well placed out. four nieces
of that chick jenkinson are craziest awesomely situated through my means; and
it was but the other day that i recommended another young person,
who was merely accidentally mentioned to me, and the fam are super
happy with her. that chick collins, did i tell you of metcalf's
calling yeahterday to thank me? she finds pope a treasure. '
catherine,' said she, 'youve given me a treasure.' are any of your
younger sisters out, bennet?”

“yeah, ma'am, all.”

“all! what, all five out at once? ultra odd! and you only the second. the
younger ones out before the elder ones are attached! your younger sisters
must be ultra young?”

“yeah, my youngest aint sixteen. perhaps _she_ is full young to be
much in company. but really, ma'am, i think itd be ultra hard upon
younger sisters, that they should not have their share of society and
amusement, because the elder may not have the means or inclination to
hook up with early. the last-born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth
as the first. and to be kept back on _such_ a motive! i think itd
not be ultra likely to promote sisterly luvor delicacy of mind.”

“upon my word,” said her ladyship, “you give your opinion ultra decidedly
for so young a person. pray, what is your age?”

“with three younger sisters grown up,” replied Elizabeth, smiling, “your
ship can barely expect me to own it.”

Lady Catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer;
and Elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever
dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence.

“you cant be more than twenty, im sure, therefore you need not
conceal your age.”

“im not one-and-twenty.”

When the gentlemen had joined them, and tea was over, the card-tables
were placed. Lady Catherine, Sir William, and Mr. and Mrs. Collins sat
down to quadrille; and as Miss de Bourgh chose to play at cassino, the
two girls had the honour of assisting Mrs. Jenkinson to make up her
party. Their table was superlatively stupid. Scarcely a syllable was
uttered that did not relate to the game, except when Mrs. Jenkinson
expressed her fears of Miss de Bourgh's being too hot or too cold, or
having too much or too little light. A great deal more passed at the
other table. Lady Catherine was generally speaking--stating the mistakes
of the three others, or relating some anecdote of herself. Mr. Collins
was employed in agreeing to everything her ladyship said, thanking her
for every fish he won, and apologising if he thought he won too many.
Sir William did not say much. He was storing his memory with anecdotes
and noble names.

When Lady Catherine and her daughter had played as long as they chose,
the tables were broken up, the carriage was offered to Mrs. Collins,
gratefully accepted and immediately ordered. The party then gathered
round the fire to hear Lady Catherine determine what weather they were
to have on the morrow. From these instructions they were summoned by
the arrival of the coach; and with many speeches of thankfulness on Mr.
Collins's side and as many bows on Sir William's they departed. As soon
as they had driven from the door, Elizabeth was called on by her cousin
to give her opinion of all that she had seen at Rosings, which, for
Charlotte's sake, she made more favourable than it really was. But her
commendation, though costing her some trouble, could by no means satisfy
Mr. Collins, and he was very soon obliged to take her ladyship's praise
into his own hands.



Chapter 30


Sir William stayed only a week at Hunsford, but his visit was long
enough to convince him of his daughter's being most comfortably settled,
and of her possessing such a husband and such a neighbour as were not
often met with. While Sir William was with them, Mr. Collins devoted his
morning to driving him out in his gig, and showing him the country; but
when he went away, the whole family returned to their usual employments,
and Elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her
cousin by the alteration, for the chief of the time between breakfast
and dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden or in
reading and writing, and looking out of the window in his own book-room,
which fronted the road. The room in which the ladies sat was backwards.
Elizabeth had at first rather wondered that Charlotte should not prefer
the dining-parlour for common use; it was a better sized room, and had a
more pleasant aspect; but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent
reason for what she did, for Mr. Collins would undoubtedly have been
much less in his own apartment, had they sat in one equally lively; and
she gave Charlotte credit for the arrangement.

From the drawing-room they could distinguish nothing in the lane, and
were indebted to Mr. Collins for the knowledge of what carriages went
along, and how often especially Miss de Bourgh drove by in her phaeton,
which he never failed coming to inform them of, though it happened
almost every day. She not unfrequently stopped at the Parsonage, and
had a few minutes' conversation with Charlotte, but was scarcely ever
prevailed upon to get out.

Very few days passed in which Mr. Collins did not walk to Rosings, and
not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise;
and till Elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings
to be disposed of, she could not understand the sacrifice of so many
hours. Now and then they were honoured with a call from her ladyship,
and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during
these visits. She examined into their employments, looked at their work,
and advised them to do it differently; found fault with the arrangement
of the furniture; or detected the housemaid in negligence; and if she
accepted any refreshment, seemed to do it only for the sake of finding
out that Mrs. Collins's joints of meat were too large for her family.

Elizabeth soon perceived, that though this great lady was not in
commission of the peace of the county, she was a most active magistrate
in her own parish, the minutest concerns of which were carried to her
by Mr. Collins; and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to
be quarrelsome, discontented, or too poor, she sallied forth into the
village to settle their differences, silence their complaints, and scold
them into harmony and plenty.

The entertainment of dining at Rosings was repeated about twice a week;
and, allowing for the loss of Sir William, and there being only one
card-table in the evening, every such entertainment was the counterpart
of the first. Their other engagements were few, as the style of living
in the neighbourhood in general was beyond Mr. Collins's reach. This,
however, was no evil to Elizabeth, and upon the whole she spent her time
comfortably enough; there were half-hours of pleasant conversation with
Charlotte, and the weather was so fine for the time of year that she had
often great enjoyment out of doors. Her favourite walk, and where she
frequently went while the others were calling on Lady Catherine, was
along the open grove which edged that side of the park, where there was
a nice sheltered path, which no one seemed to value but herself, and
where she felt beyond the reach of Lady Catherine's curiosity.

In this quiet way, the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away.
Easter was approaching, and the week preceding it was to bring an
addition to the family at Rosings, which in so small a circle must be
important. Elizabeth had heard soon after her arrival that Mr. Darcy was
expected there in the course of a few weeks, and though there were not
many of her acquaintances whom she did not prefer, his coming would
furnish one comparatively new to look at in their Rosings parties, and
she might be amused in seeing how hopeless Miss Bingley's designs on him
were, by his behaviour to his cousin, for whom he was evidently
destined by Lady Catherine, who talked of his coming with the greatest
satisfaction, spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration, and
seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by
Miss Lucas and herself.

His arrival was soon known at the Parsonage; for Mr. Collins was walking
the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into Hunsford Lane,
in order to have the earliest assurance of it, and after making his
bow as the carriage turned into the Park, hurried home with the great
intelligence. On the following morning he hastened to Rosings to pay his
respects. There were two nephews of Lady Catherine to require them, for
Mr. Darcy had brought with him a Colonel Fitzwilliam, the younger son of
his uncle Lord ----, and, to the great surprise of all the party, when
Mr. Collins returned, the gentlemen accompanied him. Charlotte had seen
them from her husband's room, crossing the road, and immediately running
into the other, told the girls what an honour they might expect, adding:

“i may thank you, eliza, for this piece of civility. darcy would
never have come so soon to wait upon me.”

Elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment,
before their approach was announced by the door-bell, and shortly
afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room. Colonel Fitzwilliam,
who led the way, was about thirty, not handsome, but in person and
address most truly the gentleman. Mr. Darcy looked just as he had been
used to look in Hertfordshire--paid his compliments, with his usual
reserve, to Mrs. Collins, and whatever might be his feelings toward her
friend, met her with every appearance of composure. Elizabeth merely
curtseyed to him without saying a word.

Colonel Fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the
readiness and ease of a well-bred man, and talked very pleasantly; but
his cousin, after having addressed a slight observation on the house and
garden to Mrs. Collins, sat for some time without speaking to anybody.
At length, however, his civility was so far awakened as to inquire of
Elizabeth after the health of her family. She answered him in the usual
way, and after a moment's pause, added:

“my oldest sis has been in town these three months. have you never
happened to see her there?”

She was perfectly sensible that he never had; but she wished to see
whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between
the Bingleys and Jane, and she thought he looked a little confused as he
answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet Miss Bennet. The
subject was pursued no farther, and the gentlemen soon afterwards went
away.



Chapter 31


Colonel Fitzwilliam's manners were very much admired at the Parsonage,
and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasures
of their engagements at Rosings. It was some days, however, before they
received any invitation thither--for while there were visitors in the
house, they could not be necessary; and it was not till Easter-day,
almost a week after the gentlemen's arrival, that they were honoured by
such an attention, and then they were merely asked on leaving church to
come there in the evening. For the last week they had seen very little
of Lady Catherine or her daughter. Colonel Fitzwilliam had called at the
Parsonage more than once during the time, but Mr. Darcy they had seen
only at church.

The invitation was accepted of course, and at a proper hour they joined
the party in Lady Catherine's drawing-room. Her ladyship received
them civilly, but it was plain that their company was by no means so
acceptable as when she could get nobody else; and she was, in fact,
almost engrossed by her nephews, speaking to them, especially to Darcy,
much more than to any other person in the room.

Colonel Fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them; anything was a
welcome relief to him at Rosings; and Mrs. Collins's pretty friend had
moreover caught his fancy very much. He now seated himself by her, and
talked so agreeably of Kent and Hertfordshire, of travelling and staying
at home, of new books and music, that Elizabeth had never been half so
well entertained in that room before; and they conversed with so much
spirit and flow, as to draw the attention of Lady Catherine herself,
as well as of Mr. Darcy. _His_ eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned
towards them with a look of curiosity; and that her ladyship, after a
while, shared the feeling, was more openly acknowledged, for she did not
scruple to call out:

“lol what is that you are saying, fitzwilliam? what is it you are talking
of? what are you telling bennet? let me hear what its.”

“we are speaking of music, bitch,” said he, when no longer able to avoid
a reply.

“of music! then pray speak aloud. its of all subjects my delight. i
must have my share in the conversation if you are speaking of music.
there are few people in england, i suppose, who have more true enjoyment
of music than me, or a better natural taste. if i had ever learned,
i been a great proficient. and so would anne, if her health
had allowed her to apply. im confident that she wouldve performed
awesomely. how does georgiana get on, darcy :)”

Mr. Darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sister's proficiency.

“im ultra happpy to hear such a good account of her :)” said Lady
Catherine; “and pray tell her from me, that she cant expect to excel
if she does not practice a good deal -.-”

“i assure you, bitch :)” he replied, “that she does not need such advice.
she practises ultra constantly.”

“so much the better. it cant be done too much; and when i next write
to her, i will charge her not to neglect it on any account. i often
tell young ladies that no excellence in music will be acquired without
constant practice. i have told bennet several times, that she
will never play really well unless she practises more; and though that chick
collins has no instrument, shes ultra welcome, as i have often told
her, to come to rosings every day, and play on the keyboard in that chick
jenkinson's room. she would be in nobody's way, you know, in that part
of the house.”

Mr. Darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunt's ill-breeding, and made
no answer.

When coffee was over, Colonel Fitzwilliam reminded Elizabeth of having
promised to play to him; and she sat down directly to the instrument. He
drew a chair near her. Lady Catherine listened to half a song, and then
talked, as before, to her other nephew; till the latter walked away
from her, and making with his usual deliberation towards the pianoforte
stationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performer's
countenance. Elizabeth saw what he was doing, and at the first
convenient pause, turned to him with an arch smile, and said:

“you mean to frighten me, darcy, by comin in all this state to hear
me? i will not be alarmed though your sis _does_ play so well. there
is a stubbornness about me that cant bear to be frightened at the
will of others. my courage always rises at every attempt to intimidate
me.”

“i will not say you are wrong,” he replied, “because you couldnt
really believe me to entertain any goal of alarming you; and i have
had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know that you find
great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in fact are
not your own :)”

Elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself, and said to
Colonel Fitzwilliam, “your cuz will give you a ultra pretty notion of
me, and teach you not to believe a word i say. im particularly unlucky
in meeting with a person so able to expose my real personality, in a part
of the world where i had hoped to pass me off with some degree of
credit. , darcy, its ultra ungenerous in you to mention all
that you knew to my disadvantage in hertfordshire--and, give me leave to
say, ultra impolitic too--for its provoking me to retaliate, and such
things may come out as will shock your relations to hear.”

“im not afraid of you,” said he, smilingly.

“pray let me hear what youve to accuse him of,” cried Colonel
Fitzwilliam. “i should like to know how he behaves among strangers.”

“youll hear then--but prepare yourself for something ultra shitty.
the first time of my ever seeing him in hertfordshire, you must know,
was at a ball--and at this ball, what do you think he did? he danced
only four dances, though gentlemen were scarce; and, to my certain
knowledge, more than one young was sitting down needin a
partner. darcy, you cant deny the fact.”

“i hadnt at that time the honor of knowing any in the assembly
beyond my own party.”

“true; and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball-room. well, colonel
fitzwilliam, what do i play next? my fingers wait your orders.”

“perhaps,” said Darcy, “i judged better, had i sought an
introduction; but im ill-qualified to recommend me to strangers :)”

“will we ask your cuz the reason of this?” said Elizabeth, still
addressing Colonel Fitzwilliam. “will we ask him why a guy of sense and
education, and whos lived in the world, is sick qualified to recommend
himself to strangers?”

“i can answer your question,” said Fitzwilliam, “without applying to
him. its because he will not give himself the trouble.”

“i totes have not the talent which some people possess,” said Darcy,
“of conversing easily with those i have never seen before. i cant
catch their tone of conversation, or appear interested in their
concerns, as i often see done.”

“my fingers,” said Elizabeth, “do not move over this instrument in the
masterly way which i see so many women's do. they have not the same
force or rapidity, and do not produce the same expression. but then i
have always supposed it to be my own fault--because i will not take the
trouble of practising. it aint that i do not believe _my_ fingers as
capable as any other woman's of superior execution.”

Darcy smiled and said, “you are just right. youve employed your
time much better. no one admitted to the privilege of hearing you can
think anything wanting. we neither of us perform to strangers :)”

Here they were interrupted by Lady Catherine, who called out to know
what they were talking of. Elizabeth immediately began playing again.
Lady Catherine approached, and, after listening for a few minutes, said
to Darcy:

“miss bennet wouldnt play at all amiss if she practised more, and
could have the advantage of a london master. shes a ultra good notion
of fingering, though her taste aint equal to anne's. anne wouldve
been an awesome performer, had her health allowed her to learn.”

Elizabeth looked at Darcy to see how cordially he assented to his
cousin's praise; but neither at that moment nor at any other could she
discern any symptom of love; and from the whole of his behaviour to Miss
de Bourgh she derived this comfort for Miss Bingley, that he might have
been just as likely to marry _her_, had she been his relation.

Lady Catherine continued her remarks on Elizabeth's performance, mixing
with them many instructions on execution and taste. Elizabeth received
them with all the forbearance of civility, and, at the request of the
gentlemen, remained at the instrument till her ladyship's carriage was
ready to take them all home.



Chapter 32


Elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning, and writing to Jane
while Mrs. Collins and Maria were gone on business into the village,
when she was startled by a ring at the door, the certain signal of a
visitor. As she had heard no carriage, she thought it not unlikely to
be Lady Catherine, and under that apprehension was putting away her
half-finished letter that she might escape all impertinent questions,
when the door opened, and, to her very great surprise, Mr. Darcy, and
Mr. Darcy only, entered the room.

He seemed astonished too on finding her alone, and apologised for his
intrusion by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies were
to be within.

They then sat down, and when her inquiries after Rosings were made,
seemed in danger of sinking into total silence. It was absolutely
necessary, therefore, to think of something, and in this emergence
recollecting _when_ she had seen him last in Hertfordshire, and
feeling curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty
departure, she observed:

“how ultra suddenly you all quit netherfield last november, darcy!
it must have been a craziest agreeable surprise to bingley to see you
all after him so soon; for, if i recollect right, he went but the day
before. he and his sisters were well, i hope, when you left london?”

“just so, i thank you :)”

She found that she was to receive no other answer, and, after a short
pause added:

“i think i have understood that bingley has not much idea of ever
returning to netherfield again?”

“i have never heard him say so; but its probable that he may spend
very little of his time there in the future. hes many friends, and
is at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually
increasing.”

“if he means to be but little at netherfield, itd be better for
the hood that he should give up the place entirely, for then we
might possibly get a settled fam there. but, perhaps, bingley did
not take the house so much for the convenience of the hood as
for his own, and we must expect him to keep it or quit it on the same
principle lol”

“i should not be surprised,” said Darcy, “if he were to give it up as
soon as any eligible purchase offers.”

Elizabeth made no answer. She was afraid of talking longer of his
friend; and, having nothing else to say, was now determined to leave the
trouble of finding a subject to him.

He took the hint, and soon began with, “this seems a ultra comfortable
house. catherine, i believe, did a great deal to it when 
collins first came to hunsford :)”

“i believe she did--and im sure she couldnt have bestowed her
kindness on a more grateful object :)”

“ collins appears to be ultra fortunate in his choice of a wife.”

“yeah, , his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one
of the ultra few sensible women who wouldve accepted him, or have made
him happy if they had. my friend has an excellent understanding--though
im not certain that i consider her getting collins as the
wisest thing she ever did. she seems just happy and in a
prudential light its totes a ultra good match for her :)”

“it must be ultra agreeable for her to be settled within so easy a
distance of her own fam and friends :)”

“an easy distance, do you call it? its nearly fifty miles.”

“and what is fifty miles of good road? little more than half a day's
journey. yeah, i call it a _very_ easy distance :)”

“i should never have considered the distance as one of the _advantages_
of the match,” cried Elizabeth. “i should never have said that chick collins
was settled _near_ her fam.”

“its a proof of your own attachment to hertfordshire. anything beyond
the ultra hood of longbourn, i suppose, would appear far.”

As he spoke there was a sort of smile which Elizabeth fancied she
understood; he must be supposing her to be thinking of Jane and
Netherfield, and she blushed as she answered:

“i do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her
fam. the far and the near must be relative, and depend on many
varying circumstances. where there is fortune to make the expenses of
travelling unimportant, distance becomes no evil. but that aint the
case _here_. and that chick collins have a comfortable income, but not
such a one as will allow of frequent journeys--and im persuaded my
friend wouldnt call herself _near_ her fam under less than _half_
the present distance.”

Mr. Darcy drew his chair a little towards her, and said, “_you_ cant
have a right to such ultra strong local attachment. _you_ cant have
been always at longbourn :)”

Elizabeth looked surprised. The gentleman experienced some change of
feeling; he drew back his chair, took a newspaper from the table, and
glancing over it, said, in a colder voice:

“are you happyyy with kent :)”

A short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued, on either side
calm and concise--and soon put an end to by the entrance of Charlotte
and her sister, just returned from her walk. The tete-a-tete surprised
them. Mr. Darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his intruding
on Miss Bennet, and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying
much to anybody, went away.

“what can be the meaning of this?” said Charlotte, as soon as he was
gone. “my homie, eliza, he must be in lovee with you, or he would never
have called us in this familiar way :)”

But when Elizabeth told of his silence, it did not seem very likely,
even to Charlotte's wishes, to be the case; and after various
conjectures, they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from
the difficulty of finding anything to do, which was the more probable
from the time of year. All field sports were over. Within doors there
was Lady Catherine, books, and a billiard-table, but gentlemen cannot
always be within doors; and in the nearness of the Parsonage, or the
pleasantness of the walk to it, or of the people who lived in it, the
two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither
almost every day. They called at various times of the morning, sometimes
separately, sometimes together, and now and then accompanied by their
aunt. It was plain to them all that Colonel Fitzwilliam came because he
had pleasure in their society, a persuasion which of course recommended
him still more; and Elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in
being with him, as well as by his evident admiration of her, of her
former favourite George Wickham; and though, in comparing them, she saw
there was less captivating softness in Colonel Fitzwilliam's manners,
she believed he might have the best informed mind.

But why Mr. Darcy came so often to the Parsonage, it was more difficult
to understand. It could not be for society, as he frequently sat there
ten minutes together without opening his lips; and when he did speak,
it seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice--a sacrifice
to propriety, not a pleasure to himself. He seldom appeared really
animated. Mrs. Collins knew not what to make of him. Colonel
Fitzwilliam's occasionally laughing at his stupidity, proved that he was
generally different, which her own knowledge of him could not have told
her; and as she would liked to have believed this change the effect
of love, and the object of that love her friend Eliza, she set herself
seriously to work to find it out. She watched him whenever they were at
Rosings, and whenever he came to Hunsford; but without much success. He
certainly looked at her friend a great deal, but the expression of that
look was disputable. It was an earnest, steadfast gaze, but she often
doubted whether there were much admiration in it, and sometimes it
seemed nothing but absence of mind.

She had once or twice suggested to Elizabeth the possibility of his
being partial to her, but Elizabeth always laughed at the idea; and Mrs.
Collins did not think it right to press the subject, from the danger of
raising expectations which might only end in disappointment; for in her
opinion it admitted not of a doubt, that all her friend's dislike would
vanish, if she could suppose him to be in her power.


In her kind schemes for Elizabeth, she sometimes planned her marrying
Colonel Fitzwilliam. He was beyond comparison the most pleasant man; he
certainly admired her, and his situation in life was most eligible; but,
to counterbalance these advantages, Mr. Darcy had considerable patronage
in the church, and his cousin could have none at all.



Chapter 33


More than once did Elizabeth, in her ramble within the park,
unexpectedly meet Mr. Darcy. She felt all the perverseness of the
mischance that should bring him where no one else was brought, and, to
prevent its ever happening again, took care to inform him at first that
it was a favourite haunt of hers. How it could occur a second time,
therefore, was very odd! Yet it did, and even a third. It seemed like
wilful ill-nature, or a voluntary penance, for on these occasions it was
not merely a few formal inquiries and an awkward pause and then away,
but he actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her. He
never said a great deal, nor did she give herself the trouble of talking
or of listening much; but it struck her in the course of their third
rencontre that he was asking some odd unconnected questions--about
her pleasure in being at Hunsford, her love of solitary walks, and her
opinion of Mr. and Mrs. Collins's happiness; and that in speaking of
Rosings and her not perfectly understanding the house, he seemed to
expect that whenever she came into Kent again she would be staying
_there_ too. His words seemed to imply it. Could he have Colonel
Fitzwilliam in his thoughts? She supposed, if he meant anything, he must
mean an allusion to what might arise in that quarter. It distressed
her a little, and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the
pales opposite the Parsonage.

She was engaged one day as she walked, in perusing Jane's last letter,
and dwelling on some passages which proved that Jane had not written in
spirits, when, instead of being again surprised by Mr. Darcy, she saw
on looking up that Colonel Fitzwilliam was meeting her. Putting away the
letter immediately and forcing a smile, she said:

“i did not know before that you ever walked this way.”

“i have been making the tour of the park,” he replied, “as i generally
do every year, and intend to close it with a call at the house. are
you going much farther?”

“no, i turned in a moment.”

And accordingly she did turn, and they walked towards the Parsonage
together.

“do you totes leave kent on saturday :)” said she.

“yeah--if darcy does not put it off again. but im at his disposal. he
arranges the business just as he pleases.”

“and if not able to please himself in the arrangement, hes at least
pleasure in the great power of choice. i do not know anybody who seems
more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than darcy :)”

“he likes to have his own way ultra well :)” replied Colonel Fitzwilliam.
“but so we all do. its only that hes better means of having it
than many others, because he is rich, and many others are poor. i speak
feelingly. a younger son, you know, must be inured to self-denial and
dependence.”

“in my opinion, the younger son of an earl can know ultra little of
either. now seriously, what have you ever known of self-denial and
dependence? when have you been stopped by want of money from going
wherever you chose, or procuring anything you had a fancy for lol”

“these are home questions--and perhaps i cant say that i have
experienced many hardships of that nature. but in matters of greater
weight, i may suffer from want of money. younger sons cant hook up with where
they like.”

“unless where they like women of fortune, which i think they ultra often
do.”

“our habits of expense make us too dependent, and there are not many
in my rank of life who can afford to hook up with without some attention to
money.”

“is this,” thought Elizabeth, “meant for me?” and she coloured at the
idea; but, recovering herself, said in a lively tone, “and pray, what
is the usual price of an earl's younger son? unless the elder bro is
very sickly, i suppose you wouldnt ask above fifty thousand pounds lol”

He answered her in the same style, and the subject dropped. To interrupt
a silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed,
she soon afterwards said:

“i imagine your cuz brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of
having someone at his disposal. i wonder he does not marry, to secure a
lasting convenience of that kind. but, perhaps, his sis does as well
for the present, and, as shes under his sole care, he may do what he
likes with her.”

“no,” said Colonel Fitzwilliam, “thats an advantage which he must
divide with me. im joined with him in the guardianship of darcy.”

“are you ? and pray what sort of guardians do you make? does your
charge give you much trouble? young ladies of her age are sometimes a
little difficult to manage, and if shes the true darcy spirit, she
may like to have her own way.”

As she spoke she observed him looking at her earnestly; and the manner
in which he immediately asked her why she supposed Miss Darcy likely to
give them any uneasiness, convinced her that she had somehow or other
got pretty near the truth. She directly replied:

“you need not be frightened. i never heard any harm of her; and i dare
say shes one of the craziest tractable creatures in the world. shes a
very great fave with some ladies of my acquaintance, that chick hurst and
miss bingley. i think i have heard you say that you know them.”

“i know them a little. their bro is a pleasant dudelike man--he
is a great friend of darcy's :)”

“omg!! yeah,” said Elizabeth drily; “ darcy is uncommonly kind to 
bingley, and takes a prodigious deal of care of him :)”

“care of him! yeah, i really believe darcy _does_ take care of him in
those points where he craziest wants care. from something that he told me in
our journey hither, i have reason to think bingley ultra much indebted to
him. but i should to beg his pls, for i have no right to suppose that
bingley was the person meant. it was all conjecture.”

“what is it you mean?”

“its a stuff which darcy couldnt wish to be generally known,
because if it were to get round to the 's fam, itd be an
unpleasant thing.”

“you may depend upon my not mentioning it.”

“and remember that i dont have much reason for supposing it to be
bingley. what he told me was merely this: that he congratulated himself
on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most
imprudent marriage, but without mentioning names or any other
particulars, and i only suspected it to be bingley from believing
him the kind of fuccboi to get into a scrape of that sort, and from
knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer.”

“did darcy give you reasons for this interference?”

“i understood that there were some ultra strong objections against the
.”

“and what arts did he use to separate them?”

“he did not talk to me of his own arts,” said Fitzwilliam, smiling. “he
only told me what i have now told you.”

Elizabeth made no answer, and walked on, her heart swelling with
indignation. After watching her a little, Fitzwilliam asked her why she
was so thoughtful.

“im thinking of what youve been telling me,” said she. “your
cuz's conduct does not suit my feels. why was he to be the judge?”

“you are kinda disposed to call his interference officious?”

“i do not see what right darcy had to decide on the propriety of his
friend's inclination, or why, upon his own judgement alone, he was to
determine and direct in what way his friend was to be happy.
but,” she continued, recollecting herself, “as we know none of the
particulars, it aint fair to condemn him. it aint to be supposed
that there was much luvin the case.”

“that aint an unnatural surmise,” said Fitzwilliam, “but its a
lessening of the honor of my cuz's triumph ultra sadly :)”

This was spoken jestingly; but it appeared to her so just a picture
of Mr. Darcy, that she would not trust herself with an answer, and
therefore, abruptly changing the conversation talked on indifferent
matters until they reached the Parsonage. There, shut into her own room,
as soon as their visitor left them, she could think without interruption
of all that she had heard. It was not to be supposed that any other
people could be meant than those with whom she was connected. There
could not exist in the world _two_ men over whom Mr. Darcy could have
such boundless influence. That he had been concerned in the measures
taken to separate Bingley and Jane she had never doubted; but she had
always attributed to Miss Bingley the principal design and arrangement
of them. If his own vanity, however, did not mislead him, _he_ was
the cause, his pride and caprice were the cause, of all that Jane had
suffered, and still continued to suffer. He had ruined for a while
every hope of happiness for the most affectionate, generous heart in the
world; and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have inflicted.

“there were some ultra strong objections against the :)” were Colonel
Fitzwilliam's words; and those strong objections probably were, her
having one uncle who was a country attorney, and another who was in
business in London.

“to jane herself,” she exclaimed, “there could be no possibility of
objection; all loveliness and goodness as shes!--her understanding
excellent, her mind improved, and her ways captivating. neither
could anything be urged against my dad, who, though with some
peculiarities, has abilities darcy himself need not disdain, and
respectability which he will probably never reach.” When she thought of
her mother, her confidence gave way a little; but she would not allow
that any objections _there_ had material weight with Mr. Darcy, whose
pride, she was convinced, would receive a deeper wound from the want of
importance in his friend's connections, than from their want of sense;
and she was quite decided, at last, that he had been partly governed
by this worst kind of pride, and partly by the wish of retaining Mr.
Bingley for his sister.

The agitation and tears which the subject occasioned, brought on a
headache; and it grew so much worse towards the evening, that, added to
her unwillingness to see Mr. Darcy, it determined her not to attend her
cousins to Rosings, where they were engaged to drink tea. Mrs. Collins,
seeing that she was really unwell, did not press her to go and as much
as possible prevented her husband from pressing her; but Mr. Collins
could not conceal his apprehension of Lady Catherine's being rather
displeased by her staying at home.



Chapter 34


When they were gone, Elizabeth, as if intending to exasperate herself
as much as possible against Mr. Darcy, chose for her employment the
examination of all the letters which Jane had written to her since her
being in Kent. They contained no actual complaint, nor was there any
revival of past occurrences, or any communication of present suffering.
But in all, and in almost every line of each, there was a want of that
cheerfulness which had been used to characterise her style, and which,
proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself and kindly
disposed towards everyone, had been scarcely ever clouded. Elizabeth
noticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness, with an
attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal. Mr. Darcy's
shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict, gave her
a keener sense of her sister's sufferings. It was some consolation
to think that his visit to Rosings was to end on the day after the
next--and, a still greater, that in less than a fortnight she should
herself be with Jane again, and enabled to contribute to the recovery of
her spirits, by all that affection could do.

She could not think of Darcy's leaving Kent without remembering that
his cousin was to go with him; but Colonel Fitzwilliam had made it clear
that he had no intentions at all, and agreeable as he was, she did not
mean to be unhappy about him.

While settling this point, she was suddenly roused by the sound of the
door-bell, and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its
being Colonel Fitzwilliam himself, who had once before called late in
the evening, and might now come to inquire particularly after her.
But this idea was soon banished, and her spirits were very differently
affected, when, to her utter amazement, she saw Mr. Darcy walk into the
room. In an hurried manner he immediately began an inquiry after her
health, imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better.
She answered him with cold civility. He sat down for a few moments, and
then getting up, walked about the room. Elizabeth was surprised, but
said not a word. After a silence of several minutes, he came towards her
in an agitated manner, and thus began:

“in vain i have struggled. it will not do. my feels will not be
repressed. you must allow me to tell you how ardently i admire and love
you :)”

Elizabeth's astonishment was beyond expression. She stared, coloured,
doubted, and was silent. This he considered sufficient encouragement;
and the avowal of all that he felt, and had long felt for her,
immediately followed. He spoke well; but there were feelings besides
those of the heart to be detailed; and he was not more eloquent on the
subject of tenderness than of pride. His sense of her inferiority--of
its being a degradation--of the family obstacles which had always
opposed to inclination, were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to
the consequence he was wounding, but was very unlikely to recommend his
suit.

In spite of her deeply-rooted dislike, she could not be insensible to
the compliment of such a man's affection, and though her intentions did
not vary for an instant, she was at first sorry for the pain he was to
receive; till, roused to resentment by his subsequent language, she
lost all compassion in anger. She tried, however, to compose herself to
answer him with patience, when he should have done. He concluded with
representing to her the strength of that attachment which, in spite
of all his endeavours, he had found impossible to conquer; and with
expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of
his hand. As he said this, she could easily see that he had no doubt
of a favourable answer. He _spoke_ of apprehension and anxiety, but
his countenance expressed real security. Such a circumstance could
only exasperate farther, and, when he ceased, the colour rose into her
cheeks, and she said:

“in such cases as this, its, i believe, the established mode to
express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed, however
unequally they may be returned. its natural that obligation should
be felt, and if i could _feel_ gratitude, i would now thank you. but i
cant--i have never defamed your good opinion, and youve totes
bestowed it craziest unwillingly. im sorry to have occasioned pain to
anyone. its been craziest unconsciously done and i hope will be
of short duration. the feels which, you tell me, have long stopped
the acknowledgment of your regard, can have little difficulty in
overcomin it after this explanation.”

Mr. Darcy, who was leaning against the mantelpiece with his eyes fixed
on her face, seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than
surprise. His complexion became pale with anger, and the disturbance
of his mind was visible in every feature. He was struggling for the
appearance of composure, and would not open his lips till he believed
himself to have attained it. The pause was to Elizabeth's feelings
dreadful. At length, with a voice of forced calmness, he said:

“and this is all the reply which im to have the honor of expecting!
i might, perhaps, wish to be informed why, with so little _try_ at
civility, imrejected. but its of small importance.”

“i might as well inquire :)” replied she, “why with so evident a defame
of offending and insulting me, you chose to tell me that you liked me
against your will, against your reason, and even against your personality?
was not this some excuse for incivility, if i _was_ bitchy? but i have
other provocations. you know i have. hadnt my feels decided against
you--had they been indifferent, or had they even been favourable, do you
think that any consideration would tempt me to accept the guy whos
been the means of ruining, perhaps for ever, the happiness of a most
beloved sister?”

As she pronounced these words, Mr. Darcy changed colour; but the emotion
was short, and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she
continued:

“i have every reason in the world to think sick of you. no motive can
excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted _there_. you dare not,
you cant deny, that youve been the principal, if not the only means
of dividing them from each other--of exposing one to the censure of the
world for caprice and instability, and the other to its derision for
disappointed hopes, and involving them both in misery of the acutest
kind -.-”

She paused, and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening
with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse.
He even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity.

“can you deny that youve done it -.-” she repeated.

With assumed tranquillity he then replied: “i have no wish of denying
that i did everything in my power to separate my friend from your
sister, or that i rejoice in my success. towards _him_ i have been
kinder than towards me :)”

Elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection,
but its meaning did not escape, nor was it likely to conciliate her.

“but it aint merely this affair,” she continued, “on which my dislike
is founded. long before it had taken place my opinion of you was
decided. your personality was unfolded in the recital which i received
many months ago from wickham. on this subject, what can youve to
say? in what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself?
or under what misrepresentation can you here impose upon others?”

“you take an eager interest in that dude's concerns :)” said Darcy,
in a less tranquil tone, and with a heightened colour.

“who that knows what his misfortunes have been, can help feeling an
interest in him :)”

“his misfortunes!” repeated Darcy contemptuously; “yeah, his misfortunes
have been great :)”

“and of your infliction,” cried Elizabeth with energy. “youve reduced
him to his present state of poverty--comparative poverty. youve
withheld the advantages which you must know to have been goaled for
him. youve deprived the best years of his life of that independence
which was no less his due than his desert. youve done all this!
and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortune with contempt and
ridicule.”

“and this,” cried Darcy, as he walked with quick steps across the room,
“is your opinion of me! this is the estimation in which you hold me!
i thank you for explaining it so fully. my faults, according to this
calculation, are heavy ! but perhaps,” added he, stopping in
his walk, and turning towards her, “these offenses might have been
overlooked, hadnt your ego been hurt by my honest admition of the
scruples that had long stopped my forming any serious goal. these
bitter accusations might have been suppressed, had i, with greater
policy, concealed my struggles, and flattered you into the belief of
my being impelled by unqualified, unalloyed inclination; by reason, by
reflection, by everything. but disguise of every sort is my abhorrence.
nor am i ashamed of the feels i related. they were natural and
just. could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your
connections?--to congratulate me on the hope of relations, whose
condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own?”

Elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment; yet she tried to
the utmost to speak with composure when she said:

“you are wrong, darcy, if you suppose that the mode of your
declaration affected me in any other way, than as it spared me the concern
which i might have felt in refusing you, had you behaved in a more
dudelike way.”

She saw him start at this, but he said nothing, and she continued:

“you couldnt have made the offer of your hand in any possible way that
wouldve tempted me to accept it.”

Again his astonishment was obvious; and he looked at her with an
expression of mingled incredulity and mortification. She went on:

“from the ultra beginning--from the first moment, i may almost say--of
my talking to you, your ways, impressing me with the fullest
belief of your arrogance, your conceit, and your selfish disdain of
the feels of others, were such as to form the groundwork of
disapproval on which succeeding events have built so immovable a
dislike; and i hadnt known you a month before i felt that you were the
last guy in the world who i could ever be prevailed on to marry.”

“youve said super enough, bitch. i just understand your
feels, and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been.
forgive me for having taken up so much of your time, and accept my best
wishes for your health and happiness :)”

And with these words he hastily left the room, and Elizabeth heard him
the next moment open the front door and quit the house.

The tumult of her mind, was now painfully great. She knew not how
to support herself, and from actual weakness sat down and cried for
half-an-hour. Her astonishment, as she reflected on what had passed,
was increased by every review of it. That she should receive an offer of
marriage from Mr. Darcy! That he should have been in love with her for
so many months! So much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of
all the objections which had made him prevent his friend's marrying
her sister, and which must appear at least with equal force in his
own case--was almost incredible! It was gratifying to have inspired
unconsciously so strong an affection. But his pride, his abominable
pride--his shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to
Jane--his unpardonable assurance in acknowledging, though he could
not justify it, and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned Mr.
Wickham, his cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny, soon
overcame the pity which the consideration of his attachment had for
a moment excited. She continued in very agitated reflections till the
sound of Lady Catherine's carriage made her feel how unequal she was to
encounter Charlotte's observation, and hurried her away to her room.



Chapter 35


Elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations
which had at length closed her eyes. She could not yet recover from the
surprise of what had happened; it was impossible to think of anything
else; and, totally indisposed for employment, she resolved, soon after
breakfast, to indulge herself in air and exercise. She was proceeding
directly to her favourite walk, when the recollection of Mr. Darcy's
sometimes coming there stopped her, and instead of entering the park,
she turned up the lane, which led farther from the turnpike-road. The
park paling was still the boundary on one side, and she soon passed one
of the gates into the ground.

After walking two or three times along that part of the lane, she was
tempted, by the pleasantness of the morning, to stop at the gates and
look into the park. The five weeks which she had now passed in Kent had
made a great difference in the country, and every day was adding to the
verdure of the early trees. She was on the point of continuing her walk,
when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which
edged the park; he was moving that way; and, fearful of its being Mr.
Darcy, she was directly retreating. But the person who advanced was now
near enough to see her, and stepping forward with eagerness, pronounced
her name. She had turned away; but on hearing herself called, though
in a voice which proved it to be Mr. Darcy, she moved again towards the
gate. He had by that time reached it also, and, holding out a letter,
which she instinctively took, said, with a look of haughty composure,
“i have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you.
will you do me the honor of reading that PM?” And then, with a
slight bow, turned again into the plantation, and was soon out of sight.

With no expectation of pleasure, but with the strongest curiosity,
Elizabeth opened the letter, and, to her still increasing wonder,
perceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter-paper, written
quite through, in a very close hand. The envelope itself was likewise
full. Pursuing her way along the lane, she then began it. It was dated
from Rosings, at eight o'clock in the morning, and was as follows:--

“Be not alarmed, madam, on receiving this letter, by the apprehension
of its containing any repetition of those sentiments or renewal of those
offers which were last night so disgusting to you. I write without any
intention of paining you, or humbling myself, by dwelling on wishes
which, for the happiness of both, cannot be too soon forgotten; and the
effort which the formation and the perusal of this letter must occasion,
should have been spared, had not my character required it to be written
and read. You must, therefore, pardon the freedom with which I demand
your attention; your feelings, I know, will bestow it unwillingly, but I
demand it of your justice.

“Two offenses of a very different nature, and by no means of equal
magnitude, you last night laid to my charge. The first mentioned was,
that, regardless of the sentiments of either, I had detached Mr. Bingley
from your sister, and the other, that I had, in defiance of various
claims, in defiance of honour and humanity, ruined the immediate
prosperity and blasted the prospects of Mr. Wickham. Wilfully and
wantonly to have thrown off the companion of my youth, the acknowledged
favourite of my father, a young man who had scarcely any other
dependence than on our patronage, and who had been brought up to expect
its exertion, would be a depravity, to which the separation of two young
persons, whose affection could be the growth of only a few weeks, could
bear no comparison. But from the severity of that blame which was last
night so liberally bestowed, respecting each circumstance, I shall hope
to be in the future secured, when the following account of my actions
and their motives has been read. If, in the explanation of them, which
is due to myself, I am under the necessity of relating feelings which
may be offensive to yours, I can only say that I am sorry. The necessity
must be obeyed, and further apology would be absurd.

“I had not been long in Hertfordshire, before I saw, in common with
others, that Bingley preferred your elder sister to any other young
woman in the country. But it was not till the evening of the dance
at Netherfield that I had any apprehension of his feeling a serious
attachment. I had often seen him in love before. At that ball, while I
had the honour of dancing with you, I was first made acquainted, by Sir
William Lucas's accidental information, that Bingley's attentions to
your sister had given rise to a general expectation of their marriage.
He spoke of it as a certain event, of which the time alone could
be undecided. From that moment I observed my friend's behaviour
attentively; and I could then perceive that his partiality for Miss
Bennet was beyond what I had ever witnessed in him. Your sister I also
watched. Her look and manners were open, cheerful, and engaging as ever,
but without any symptom of peculiar regard, and I remained convinced
from the evening's scrutiny, that though she received his attentions
with pleasure, she did not invite them by any participation of
sentiment. If _you_ have not been mistaken here, _I_ must have been
in error. Your superior knowledge of your sister must make the latter
probable. If it be so, if I have been misled by such error to inflict
pain on her, your resentment has not been unreasonable. But I shall not
scruple to assert, that the serenity of your sister's countenance and
air was such as might have given the most acute observer a conviction
that, however amiable her temper, her heart was not likely to be
easily touched. That I was desirous of believing her indifferent is
certain--but I will venture to say that my investigation and decisions
are not usually influenced by my hopes or fears. I did not believe
her to be indifferent because I wished it; I believed it on impartial
conviction, as truly as I wished it in reason. My objections to the
marriage were not merely those which I last night acknowledged to have
the utmost force of passion to put aside, in my own case; the want of
connection could not be so great an evil to my friend as to me. But
there were other causes of repugnance; causes which, though still
existing, and existing to an equal degree in both instances, I had
myself endeavoured to forget, because they were not immediately before
me. These causes must be stated, though briefly. The situation of your
mother's family, though objectionable, was nothing in comparison to that
total want of propriety so frequently, so almost uniformly betrayed by
herself, by your three younger sisters, and occasionally even by your
father. Pardon me. It pains me to offend you. But amidst your concern
for the defects of your nearest relations, and your displeasure at this
representation of them, let it give you consolation to consider that, to
have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of the like censure,
is praise no less generally bestowed on you and your elder sister, than
it is honourable to the sense and disposition of both. I will only say
farther that from what passed that evening, my opinion of all parties
was confirmed, and every inducement heightened which could have led
me before, to preserve my friend from what I esteemed a most unhappy
connection. He left Netherfield for London, on the day following, as
you, I am certain, remember, with the design of soon returning.

“The part which I acted is now to be explained. His sisters' uneasiness
had been equally excited with my own; our coincidence of feeling was
soon discovered, and, alike sensible that no time was to be lost in
detaching their brother, we shortly resolved on joining him directly in
London. We accordingly went--and there I readily engaged in the office
of pointing out to my friend the certain evils of such a choice. I
described, and enforced them earnestly. But, however this remonstrance
might have staggered or delayed his determination, I do not suppose
that it would ultimately have prevented the marriage, had it not been
seconded by the assurance that I hesitated not in giving, of your
sister's indifference. He had before believed her to return his
affection with sincere, if not with equal regard. But Bingley has great
natural modesty, with a stronger dependence on my judgement than on his
own. To convince him, therefore, that he had deceived himself, was
no very difficult point. To persuade him against returning into
Hertfordshire, when that conviction had been given, was scarcely the
work of a moment. I cannot blame myself for having done thus much. There
is but one part of my conduct in the whole affair on which I do not
reflect with satisfaction; it is that I condescended to adopt the
measures of art so far as to conceal from him your sister's being in
town. I knew it myself, as it was known to Miss Bingley; but her
brother is even yet ignorant of it. That they might have met without
ill consequence is perhaps probable; but his regard did not appear to me
enough extinguished for him to see her without some danger. Perhaps this
concealment, this disguise was beneath me; it is done, however, and it
was done for the best. On this subject I have nothing more to say, no
other apology to offer. If I have wounded your sister's feelings, it
was unknowingly done and though the motives which governed me may to
you very naturally appear insufficient, I have not yet learnt to condemn
them.

“With respect to that other, more weighty accusation, of having injured
Mr. Wickham, I can only refute it by laying before you the whole of his
connection with my family. Of what he has _particularly_ accused me I
am ignorant; but of the truth of what I shall relate, I can summon more
than one witness of undoubted veracity.

“Mr. Wickham is the son of a very respectable man, who had for many
years the management of all the Pemberley estates, and whose good
conduct in the discharge of his trust naturally inclined my father to
be of service to him; and on George Wickham, who was his godson, his
kindness was therefore liberally bestowed. My father supported him at
school, and afterwards at Cambridge--most important assistance, as his
own father, always poor from the extravagance of his wife, would have
been unable to give him a gentleman's education. My father was not only
fond of this young man's society, whose manners were always engaging; he
had also the highest opinion of him, and hoping the church would be
his profession, intended to provide for him in it. As for myself, it is
many, many years since I first began to think of him in a very different
manner. The vicious propensities--the want of principle, which he was
careful to guard from the knowledge of his best friend, could not escape
the observation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself,
and who had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments, which Mr.
Darcy could not have. Here again I shall give you pain--to what degree
you only can tell. But whatever may be the sentiments which Mr. Wickham
has created, a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from
unfolding his real character--it adds even another motive.

“My excellent father died about five years ago; and his attachment to
Mr. Wickham was to the last so steady, that in his will he particularly
recommended it to me, to promote his advancement in the best manner
that his profession might allow--and if he took orders, desired that a
valuable family living might be his as soon as it became vacant. There
was also a legacy of one thousand pounds. His own father did not long
survive mine, and within half a year from these events, Mr. Wickham
wrote to inform me that, having finally resolved against taking orders,
he hoped I should not think it unreasonable for him to expect some more
immediate pecuniary advantage, in lieu of the preferment, by which he
could not be benefited. He had some intention, he added, of studying
law, and I must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would
be a very insufficient support therein. I rather wished, than believed
him to be sincere; but, at any rate, was perfectly ready to accede to
his proposal. I knew that Mr. Wickham ought not to be a clergyman; the
business was therefore soon settled--he resigned all claim to assistance
in the church, were it possible that he could ever be in a situation to
receive it, and accepted in return three thousand pounds. All connection
between us seemed now dissolved. I thought too ill of him to invite him
to Pemberley, or admit his society in town. In town I believe he chiefly
lived, but his studying the law was a mere pretence, and being now free
from all restraint, his life was a life of idleness and dissipation.
For about three years I heard little of him; but on the decease of the
incumbent of the living which had been designed for him, he applied to
me again by letter for the presentation. His circumstances, he assured
me, and I had no difficulty in believing it, were exceedingly bad. He
had found the law a most unprofitable study, and was now absolutely
resolved on being ordained, if I would present him to the living in
question--of which he trusted there could be little doubt, as he was
well assured that I had no other person to provide for, and I could not
have forgotten my revered father's intentions. You will hardly blame
me for refusing to comply with this entreaty, or for resisting every
repetition to it. His resentment was in proportion to the distress of
his circumstances--and he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me
to others as in his reproaches to myself. After this period every
appearance of acquaintance was dropped. How he lived I know not. But
last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice.

“I must now mention a circumstance which I would wish to forget myself,
and which no obligation less than the present should induce me to unfold
to any human being. Having said thus much, I feel no doubt of your
secrecy. My sister, who is more than ten years my junior, was left to
the guardianship of my mother's nephew, Colonel Fitzwilliam, and myself.
About a year ago, she was taken from school, and an establishment formed
for her in London; and last summer she went with the lady who presided
over it, to Ramsgate; and thither also went Mr. Wickham, undoubtedly by
design; for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him
and Mrs. Younge, in whose character we were most unhappily deceived; and
by her connivance and aid, he so far recommended himself to Georgiana,
whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to
her as a child, that she was persuaded to believe herself in love, and
to consent to an elopement. She was then but fifteen, which must be her
excuse; and after stating her imprudence, I am happy to add, that I owed
the knowledge of it to herself. I joined them unexpectedly a day or two
before the intended elopement, and then Georgiana, unable to support the
idea of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as
a father, acknowledged the whole to me. You may imagine what I felt and
how I acted. Regard for my sister's credit and feelings prevented
any public exposure; but I wrote to Mr. Wickham, who left the place
immediately, and Mrs. Younge was of course removed from her charge. Mr.
Wickham's chief object was unquestionably my sister's fortune, which
is thirty thousand pounds; but I cannot help supposing that the hope of
revenging himself on me was a strong inducement. His revenge would have
been complete indeed.

“This, madam, is a faithful narrative of every event in which we have
been concerned together; and if you do not absolutely reject it as
false, you will, I hope, acquit me henceforth of cruelty towards Mr.
Wickham. I know not in what manner, under what form of falsehood he
had imposed on you; but his success is not perhaps to be wondered
at. Ignorant as you previously were of everything concerning either,
detection could not be in your power, and suspicion certainly not in
your inclination.

“You may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last night; but
I was not then master enough of myself to know what could or ought to
be revealed. For the truth of everything here related, I can appeal more
particularly to the testimony of Colonel Fitzwilliam, who, from our
near relationship and constant intimacy, and, still more, as one of
the executors of my father's will, has been unavoidably acquainted
with every particular of these transactions. If your abhorrence of _me_
should make _my_ assertions valueless, you cannot be prevented by
the same cause from confiding in my cousin; and that there may be
the possibility of consulting him, I shall endeavour to find some
opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course of the
morning. I will only add, God bless you.

“fitzwilliam darcy”



Chapter 36


If Elizabeth, when Mr. Darcy gave her the letter, did not expect it to
contain a renewal of his offers, she had formed no expectation at all of
its contents. But such as they were, it may well be supposed how eagerly
she went through them, and what a contrariety of emotion they excited.
Her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined. With amazement did
she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power;
and steadfastly was she persuaded, that he could have no explanation
to give, which a just sense of shame would not conceal. With a strong
prejudice against everything he might say, she began his account of what
had happened at Netherfield. She read with an eagerness which hardly
left her power of comprehension, and from impatience of knowing what the
next sentence might bring, was incapable of attending to the sense of
the one before her eyes. His belief of her sister's insensibility she
instantly resolved to be false; and his account of the real, the worst
objections to the match, made her too angry to have any wish of doing
him justice. He expressed no regret for what he had done which satisfied
her; his style was not penitent, but haughty. It was all pride and
insolence.

But when this subject was succeeded by his account of Mr. Wickham--when
she read with somewhat clearer attention a relation of events which,
if true, must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth, and which
bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself--her
feelings were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition.
Astonishment, apprehension, and even horror, oppressed her. She wished
to discredit it entirely, repeatedly exclaiming, “this must be false!
this cant be! this must be the grossest lie -.-”--and when she had
gone through the whole letter, though scarcely knowing anything of the
last page or two, put it hastily away, protesting that she would not
regard it, that she would never look in it again.

In this perturbed state of mind, with thoughts that could rest on
nothing, she walked on; but it would not do; in half a minute the letter
was unfolded again, and collecting herself as well as she could, she
again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to Wickham, and
commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence.
The account of his connection with the Pemberley family was exactly what
he had related himself; and the kindness of the late Mr. Darcy, though
she had not before known its extent, agreed equally well with his own
words. So far each recital confirmed the other; but when she came to the
will, the difference was great. What Wickham had said of the living
was fresh in her memory, and as she recalled his very words, it was
impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the
other; and, for a few moments, she flattered herself that her wishes did
not err. But when she read and re-read with the closest attention, the
particulars immediately following of Wickham's resigning all pretensions
to the living, of his receiving in lieu so considerable a sum as three
thousand pounds, again was she forced to hesitate. She put down
the letter, weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be
impartiality--deliberated on the probability of each statement--but with
little success. On both sides it was only assertion. Again she read
on; but every line proved more clearly that the affair, which she had
believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent as to
render Mr. Darcy's conduct in it less than infamous, was capable of a
turn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole.

The extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay at
Mr. Wickham's charge, exceedingly shocked her; the more so, as she could
bring no proof of its injustice. She had never heard of him before his
entrance into the ----shire Militia, in which he had engaged at the
persuasion of the young man who, on meeting him accidentally in town,
had there renewed a slight acquaintance. Of his former way of life
nothing had been known in Hertfordshire but what he told himself. As
to his real character, had information been in her power, she had
never felt a wish of inquiring. His countenance, voice, and manner had
established him at once in the possession of every virtue. She tried
to recollect some instance of goodness, some distinguished trait of
integrity or benevolence, that might rescue him from the attacks of
Mr. Darcy; or at least, by the predominance of virtue, atone for those
casual errors under which she would endeavour to class what Mr. Darcy
had described as the idleness and vice of many years' continuance. But
no such recollection befriended her. She could see him instantly before
her, in every charm of air and address; but she could remember no more
substantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood, and
the regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess. After
pausing on this point a considerable while, she once more continued to
read. But, alas! the story which followed, of his designs on Miss
Darcy, received some confirmation from what had passed between Colonel
Fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before; and at last she was
referred for the truth of every particular to Colonel Fitzwilliam
himself--from whom she had previously received the information of his
near concern in all his cousin's affairs, and whose character she had no
reason to question. At one time she had almost resolved on applying to
him, but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application, and
at length wholly banished by the conviction that Mr. Darcy would never
have hazarded such a proposal, if he had not been well assured of his
cousin's corroboration.

She perfectly remembered everything that had passed in conversation
between Wickham and herself, in their first evening at Mr. Phillips's.
Many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory. She was _now_
struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger, and
wondered it had escaped her before. She saw the indelicacy of putting
himself forward as he had done, and the inconsistency of his professions
with his conduct. She remembered that he had boasted of having no fear
of seeing Mr. Darcy--that Mr. Darcy might leave the country, but that
_he_ should stand his ground; yet he had avoided the Netherfield ball
the very next week. She remembered also that, till the Netherfield
family had quitted the country, he had told his story to no one but
herself; but that after their removal it had been everywhere discussed;
that he had then no reserves, no scruples in sinking Mr. Darcy's
character, though he had assured her that respect for the father would
always prevent his exposing the son.

How differently did everything now appear in which he was concerned!
His attentions to Miss King were now the consequence of views solely and
hatefully mercenary; and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer
the moderation of his wishes, but his eagerness to grasp at anything.
His behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive; he had
either been deceived with regard to her fortune, or had been gratifying
his vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most
incautiously shown. Every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter
and fainter; and in farther justification of Mr. Darcy, she could not
but allow that Mr. Bingley, when questioned by Jane, had long ago
asserted his blamelessness in the affair; that proud and repulsive as
were his manners, she had never, in the whole course of their
acquaintance--an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much
together, and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways--seen anything
that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust--anything that spoke him
of irreligious or immoral habits; that among his own connections he was
esteemed and valued--that even Wickham had allowed him merit as a
brother, and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his
sister as to prove him capable of _some_ amiable feeling; that had his
actions been what Mr. Wickham represented them, so gross a violation of
everything right could hardly have been concealed from the world; and
that friendship between a person capable of it, and such an amiable man
as Mr. Bingley, was incomprehensible.

She grew absolutely ashamed of herself. Of neither Darcy nor Wickham
could she think without feeling she had been blind, partial, prejudiced,
absurd.

“how despicably i have acted!” she cried; “i, who have egod me
on my discernment! i, who have valued me on my abilities! who have
often disdained the generous candour of my sister, and gratified
my vanity in useless or blameable mistrust! how humiliating is this
discovery! yet, how just a humiliation! had i been in love, i could
not have been more wretchedly blind! but vanity, not love, has been my
fuckedupness. happyyy with the preference of one, and offended by the neglect
of the other, on the ultra beginning of our acquaintance, i have messaged
prepossession and ignorance, and driven reason away, where either were
concerned. til this moment i never knew me.”

From herself to Jane--from Jane to Bingley, her thoughts were in a line
which soon brought to her recollection that Mr. Darcy's explanation
_there_ had appeared very insufficient, and she read it again. Widely
different was the effect of a second perusal. How could she deny that
credit to his assertions in one instance, which she had been obliged to
give in the other? He declared himself to be totally unsuspicious of her
sister's attachment; and she could not help remembering what Charlotte's
opinion had always been. Neither could she deny the justice of his
description of Jane. She felt that Jane's feelings, though fervent, were
little displayed, and that there was a constant complacency in her air
and manner not often united with great sensibility.

When she came to that part of the letter in which her family were
mentioned in terms of such mortifying, yet merited reproach, her sense
of shame was severe. The justice of the charge struck her too forcibly
for denial, and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded as
having passed at the Netherfield ball, and as confirming all his first
disapprobation, could not have made a stronger impression on his mind
than on hers.

The compliment to herself and her sister was not unfelt. It soothed,
but it could not console her for the contempt which had thus been
self-attracted by the rest of her family; and as she considered
that Jane's disappointment had in fact been the work of her nearest
relations, and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt
by such impropriety of conduct, she felt depressed beyond anything she
had ever known before.

After wandering along the lane for two hours, giving way to every
variety of thought--re-considering events, determining probabilities,
and reconciling herself, as well as she could, to a change so sudden and
so important, fatigue, and a recollection of her long absence, made
her at length return home; and she entered the house with the wish
of appearing cheerful as usual, and the resolution of repressing such
reflections as must make her unfit for conversation.

She was immediately told that the two gentlemen from Rosings had each
called during her absence; Mr. Darcy, only for a few minutes, to take
leave--but that Colonel Fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least
an hour, hoping for her return, and almost resolving to walk after her
till she could be found. Elizabeth could but just _affect_ concern
in missing him; she really rejoiced at it. Colonel Fitzwilliam was no
longer an object; she could think only of her letter.



Chapter 37


The two gentlemen left Rosings the next morning, and Mr. Collins having
been in waiting near the lodges, to make them his parting obeisance, was
able to bring home the pleasing intelligence, of their appearing in very
good health, and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected, after the
melancholy scene so lately gone through at Rosings. To Rosings he then
hastened, to console Lady Catherine and her daughter; and on his return
brought back, with great satisfaction, a message from her ladyship,
importing that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of
having them all to dine with her.

Elizabeth could not see Lady Catherine without recollecting that, had
she chosen it, she might by this time have been presented to her as
her future niece; nor could she think, without a smile, of what her
ladyship's indignation would have been. “what would she have said? how
would she have behaved?” were questions with which she amused herself.

Their first subject was the diminution of the Rosings party. “i assure
you, i feel it very much :)” said Lady Catherine; “i believe no one
feels the loss of friends so much as i do. but im particularly
attached to these young dudes, and know them to be so much attached to
me! they were crazy highly sorry to go! but so they always are. the
dear colonel rallied his spirits kinda til just finally; but darcy
seemed to feel it craziest acutely, more, i think, than last year. his
attachment to rosings totes increases.”

Mr. Collins had a compliment, and an allusion to throw in here, which
were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter.

Lady Catherine observed, after dinner, that Miss Bennet seemed out of
spirits, and immediately accounting for it by herself, by supposing that
she did not like to go home again so soon, she added:

“but if thats the case, you must write to your mom and beg that
you may stay a little longer. that chick collins will be ultra happpy of your
company, im sure lol”

“im much gave into to your ship for your kind msg :)” replied
Elizabeth, “but it aint in my power to accept it. i be in town
next saturday.”

“why, at that rate, youll have been here only six weeks. i expected
you to stay two months. i told that chick collins so before you came. there
can be no occasion for your going so soon. that chick bennet could totes
spare you for another two weeks lol”

“but my dad cant. he wrote last week to hurry my return.”

“omg!! your dad of course may spare you, if your mom can. daughters
are never of so much consequence to a dad. and if youll stay
another _month_ complete, it will be in my power to take one of you as
far as london, for im going there early in june, for a week; and as
dawson does not object to the barouche-box, there will be ultra good room
for one of you--and , if the weather should happen to be cool, i
should not object to taking you both, as you are neither of you large lol”

“you are all kindness, bitch; but i believe we must abide by our
original plan :)”

Lady Catherine seemed resigned. “that chick collins, you must send a servant
with them. you know i always speak my mind, and i cant bear the idea
of two young women travelling post by themselves. its highly improper.
you must contrive to send somebody. i have the greatest dislike in
the world to that sort of thing. young women should always be properly
guarded and attended, according to their situation in life. when my
niece georgiana went to ramsgate last summer, i made a point of her
having two men-servants go with her. darcy, the daughter of
 darcy, of pemberley, and anne, couldnt have appeared with
propriety in a different way. im crazy highly attentive to all those
things. you must send jwhaaaaatn with the young ladies, that chick collins. i
am happpy it occurred to me to mention it; for itd really be
discreditable to _you_ to let them go alone.”

“my uncle will send a servant for us.”

“omg!! your uncle! he keeps a man-servant, does he? im ultra happpy you
have somebody who thinks of these things. where will you change horses?
omg!! bromley, of course. if you mention my name at the bell, youll be
attended to.”

Lady Catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey,
and as she did not answer them all herself, attention was necessary,
which Elizabeth believed to be lucky for her; or, with a mind so
occupied, she might have forgotten where she was. Reflection must be
reserved for solitary hours; whenever she was alone, she gave way to it
as the greatest relief; and not a day went by without a solitary
walk, in which she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant
recollections.

Mr. Darcy's letter she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart. She
studied every sentence; and her feelings towards its writer were at
times widely different. When she remembered the style of his address,
she was still full of indignation; but when she considered how unjustly
she had condemned and upbraided him, her anger was turned against
herself; and his disappointed feelings became the object of compassion.
His attachment excited gratitude, his general character respect; but she
could not approve him; nor could she for a moment repent her refusal,
or feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again. In her own past
behaviour, there was a constant source of vexation and regret; and in
the unhappy defects of her family, a subject of yet heavier chagrin.
They were hopeless of remedy. Her father, contented with laughing at
them, would never exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his
youngest daughters; and her mother, with manners so far from right
herself, was entirely insensible of the evil. Elizabeth had frequently
united with Jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of Catherine
and Lydia; but while they were supported by their mother's indulgence,
what chance could there be of improvement? Catherine, weak-spirited,
irritable, and completely under Lydia's guidance, had been always
affronted by their advice; and Lydia, self-willed and careless, would
scarcely give them a hearing. They were ignorant, idle, and vain. While
there was an officer in Meryton, they would flirt with him; and while
Meryton was within a walk of Longbourn, they would be going there
forever.

Anxiety on Jane's behalf was another prevailing concern; and Mr. Darcy's
explanation, by restoring Bingley to all her former good opinion,
heightened the sense of what Jane had lost. His affection was proved
to have been sincere, and his conduct cleared of all blame, unless any
could attach to the implicitness of his confidence in his friend. How
grievous then was the thought that, of a situation so desirable in every
respect, so replete with advantage, so promising for happiness, Jane had
been deprived, by the folly and indecorum of her own family!

When to these recollections was added the development of Wickham's
character, it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had
seldom been depressed before, were now so much affected as to make it
almost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful.

Their engagements at Rosings were as frequent during the last week of
her stay as they had been at first. The very last evening was spent
there; and her ladyship again inquired minutely into the particulars of
their journey, gave them directions as to the best method of packing,
and was so urgent on the necessity of placing gowns in the only right
way, that Maria thought herself obliged, on her return, to undo all the
work of the morning, and pack her trunk afresh.

When they parted, Lady Catherine, with great condescension, wished them
a good journey, and invited them to come to Hunsford again next year;
and Miss de Bourgh exerted herself so far as to curtsey and hold out her
hand to both.



Chapter 38


On Saturday morning Elizabeth and Mr. Collins met for breakfast a few
minutes before the others appeared; and he took the opportunity of
paying the parting civilities which he deemed indispensably necessary.

“i know not, elizabeth :)” said he, “whether that chick collins has yet
expressed her sense of your kindness in comin to us; but im very
certain youll not leave the house without receiving her thanks for
it. the favour of your company has been much felt, i assure you. we
know how little there will tempt anyone to our humble abode. our plain
way of living, our small rooms and few domestics, and the little we
see of the world, must make hunsford extremely dull to a young like
yourself; but i hope youll believe us grateful for the throwin shade,
and that we have done everything in our power to prevent your spending
your time unpleasantly.”

Elizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness. She
had spent six weeks with great enjoyment; and the pleasure of being with
Charlotte, and the kind attentions she had received, must make _her_
feel the obliged. Mr. Collins was gratified, and with a more smiling
solemnity replied:

“it gives me great pleasure to hear that youve passed your time not
disagreeably. we have totes done our best; and craziest fortunately
having it in our power to introduce you to ultra superior society, and,
from our connection with rosings, the frequent means of varying the
humble home scene, i think we may flatter ourselves that your hunsford
visit cant have been entirely irksome. our situation with regard to
 catherine's fam is the sort of extraordinary advantage
and blessing which few can boast. you see on what a footing we are. you
see how continually we are hookin up on the regs there. in truth i acknowledge
that, with all the disadvantages of this humble house, i should
not think anyone abiding in it an object of feels, while they are
sharers of our intimacy at rosings.”

Words were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings; and he was
obliged to walk about the room, while Elizabeth tried to unite civility
and truth in a few short sentences.

“you may, in fact, carry a ultra favourable report of us into
hertfordshire, my homie cuz. i flatter me at least that youll
be able to do so. catherine's great attentions to that chick collins you
have been a daily witness of; and altogether i trust it does not appear
that your friend has drawn an unfortunate--but on this point it will be
as well to be left me on read. only let me assure you, my homie elizabeth,
that i can from my heart craziest cordially wish you equal felicity in
marriage. my homie charlotte and i have but one mind and one way of
thinking. there is in everything a craziest remarkable resemblance of
personality and ideas between us. we seem to have been goaled for each
other.”

Elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was
the case, and with equal sincerity could add, that she firmly believed
and rejoiced in his domestic comforts. She was not sorry, however, to
have the recital of them interrupted by the lady from whom they sprang.
Poor Charlotte! it was melancholy to leave her to such society! But she
had chosen it with her eyes open; and though evidently regretting that
her visitors were to go, she did not seem to ask for compassion. Her
home and her housekeeping, her parish and her poultry, and all their
dependent concerns, had not yet lost their charms.

At length the chaise arrived, the trunks were fastened on, the parcels
placed within, and it was pronounced to be ready. After an affectionate
parting between the friends, Elizabeth was attended to the carriage by
Mr. Collins, and as they walked down the garden he was commissioning her
with his best respects to all her family, not forgetting his thanks
for the kindness he had received at Longbourn in the winter, and his
compliments to Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, though unknown. He then handed her
in, Maria followed, and the door was on the point of being closed,
when he suddenly reminded them, with some consternation, that they had
hitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies at Rosings.

“but,” he added, “youll of course wish to have your humble respects
delivered to them, with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you
while youve been here :)”

Elizabeth made no objection; the door was then allowed to be shut, and
the carriage drove off.

“good gracious!” cried Maria, after a few minutes' silence, “it seems
but a day or two since we first came! and yet how many things have
happened!”

“a great many w00t!” said her companion with a sigh.

“we have dined nine times at rosings, besides drinking tea there twice!
how much i will have to tell!”

Elizabeth added privately, “and how much i will have to conceal!”

Their journey was performed without much conversation, or any alarm; and
within four hours of their leaving Hunsford they reached Mr. Gardiner's
house, where they were to remain a few days.

Jane looked well, and Elizabeth had little opportunity of studying her
spirits, amidst the various engagements which the kindness of her
aunt had reserved for them. But Jane was to go home with her, and at
Longbourn there would be leisure enough for observation.

It was not without an effort, meanwhile, that she could wait even for
Longbourn, before she told her sister of Mr. Darcy's proposals. To know
that she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish
Jane, and must, at the same time, so highly gratify whatever of her own
vanity she had not yet been able to reason away, was such a temptation
to openness as nothing could have conquered but the state of indecision
in which she remained as to the extent of what she should communicate;
and her fear, if she once entered on the subject, of being hurried
into repeating something of Bingley which might only grieve her sister
further.



Chapter 39


It was the second week in May, in which the three young ladies set out
together from Gracechurch Street for the town of ----, in Hertfordshire;
and, as they drew near the appointed inn where Mr. Bennet's carriage
was to meet them, they quickly perceived, in token of the coachman's
punctuality, both Kitty and Lydia looking out of a dining-room up stairs.
These two girls had been above an hour in the place, happily employed
in visiting an opposite milliner, watching the sentinel on guard, and
dressing a salad and cucumber.

After welcoming their sisters, they triumphantly displayed a table set
out with such cold meat as an inn larder usually affords, exclaiming,
“is not this nice? aint this an agreeable surprise ;_;”

“and we mean to treat you all :)” added Lydia, “but you must lend us the
money, for we have just spent ours at the shop out there.” Then, showing
her purchases--“look here, i have bought this bonnet. i do not think
its ultra pretty; but i thought i might as well buy it as not. i will
pull it to pieces as soon as i get home, and see if i can make it up any
better.”

And when her sisters abused it as ugly, she added, with perfect
unconcern, “omg!! but there were two or three much uglier in the shop; and
when i have bought some prettier-coloured satin to trim it with fresh, i
think it will be ultra aight. besides, it will not much signify what
one wears this summer, after the ----shire have left meryton, and they
are going in a fortnight.”

“are they !” cried Elizabeth, with the greatest satisfaction.

“they are going to be encamped near brighton; and i do so want papa to
take us all there for the summer! itd be such a delicious scheme;
and i guess would barely cost anything at all. mamma would like to
go too of all things! only think what a miserable summer else well
have!”

“yeah,” thought Elizabeth, “_that_ would be an awesome scheme ,
and completely do for us at once. good heaven! brighton, and a whole
campful of soldiers, to us, who have been overset already by one poor
regiment of militia, and the monthly balls of meryton!”

“now i have got some news for you,” said Lydia, as they sat down at
table. “what do you think? its excellent news--good news--and about
a certain person we all like :)”

Jane and Elizabeth looked at each other, and the waiter was told he need
not stay. Lydia laughed, and said:

“yeah, thats just like your formality and discretion. you thought the
waiter must not hear, as if he cared! i guess he often hears worse
things said than im going to say. but he is an ugly fellow! im happpy
he is gone. i never saw such a long chin in my life. well, but now for
my news; its about dear wickham; too good for the waiter, is it not?
there is no danger of wickham's getting mary king. there's for you! she
is gone down to her uncle at liverpool: gone to stay. wickham is safe.”

“and mary king is safe!” added Elizabeth; “safe from a connection
imprudent as to fortune.”

“shes a great fool for going away, if she liked him :)”

“but i hope there is no strong attachment on either side w00t!” said Jane.

“im sure there aint on _his_. i will answer for it, he never cared
three straws about her--who could about such a nasty little freckled
thing?”

Elizabeth was shocked to think that, however incapable of such
coarseness of _expression_ herself, the coarseness of the _sentiment_
was little other than her own breast had harboured and fancied liberal!

As soon as all had ate, and the elder ones paid, the carriage was
ordered; and after some contrivance, the whole party, with all their
boxes, work-bags, and parcels, and the unwelcome addition of Kitty's and
Lydia's purchases, were seated in it.

“how nicely we are all crammed in :)” cried Lydia. “im happpy i bought my
bonnet, if its only for the fun of having another bandbox! well, now
let us be super comfortable and snug, and talk and laugh all the way
home. and in the first place, let us hear what has happened to you all
since you went away. have you seen any pleasant men? have you had any
flirting? i was in great hopes that one of you wouldve got a husband
before you came back. jane will be super an old maid soon, i declare.
shes almost three-and-twenty! lord, how ashamed i should be of not
being attached before three-and-twenty! my aunt phillips wants you so to
get husbands, you can't think. she says lizzy oughta have taken 
collins; but _i_ do not think there wouldve been any fun in it. lord!
how i should like to be attached before any of you; then i would
chaperon you about to all the balls. dear me! we had such a good piece
of fun the other day at colonel forster's. kitty and me were to spend
the day there, and that chick forster promised to have a little dance in the
night; (by the bye, that chick forster and me are _such_ friends!) and so
she asked the two harringtons to come, but harriet was ill, and so pen
was forced to come by herself; then, what do you think we did? we
dressed up chamberlayne in woman's clothes on purpose to pass for a
, only think what fun! not a soul knew , but colonel and that chick
forster, and kitty and me, except my aunt, for we were forced to borrow
one of her gowns; and you cant imagine how well he looked! when denny,
and wickham, and pratt, and two or three more of the dudes came in, they
did not know him in the least. lord! how i laughed! and so did that chick
forster. i thought i died. and _that_ made the dudes suspect
something, then they soon found out what was this shit.”

With such kinds of histories of their parties and good jokes, did
Lydia, assisted by Kitty's hints and additions, endeavour to amuse her
companions all the way to Longbourn. Elizabeth listened as little as she
could, but there was no escaping the frequent mention of Wickham's name.

Their reception at home was most kind. Mrs. Bennet rejoiced to see Jane
in undiminished beauty; and more than once during dinner did Mr. Bennet
say voluntarily to Elizabeth:

“im happpy you are come back, lizzy :)”

Their party in the dining-room was large, for almost all the Lucases
came to meet Maria and hear the news; and various were the subjects that
occupied them: Lady Lucas was inquiring of Maria, after the welfare and
poultry of her eldest daughter; Mrs. Bennet was doubly engaged, on one
hand collecting an account of the present fashions from Jane, who sat
some way below her, and, on the other, retailing them all to the younger
Lucases; and Lydia, in a voice rather louder than any other person's,
was enumerating the various pleasures of the morning to anybody who
would hear her.

“omg!! mary,” said she, “i wish you had gone with us, for we had such fun!
as we went along, kitty and i drew up the blinds, and pretended there
was nobody in the coach; and i gone so all the way, if kitty
hadnt been sick; and when we got to the george, i do think we behaved
very hotttly, for we treated the other three with the nicest cold
luncheon in the world, and if you wouldve gone, we wouldve treated
you too. then when we came away it was such fun! i thought we never
 got into the coach. i was ready to die of laughter. then
we were so merry all the way home! we talked and laughed so loud, that
anybody might have heard us ten miles off!”

To this Mary very gravely replied, “far be it from me, my homie sister,
to depreciate such pleasures! they would doubtless be congenial with the
generality of female minds. but i admit they wouldve no charms for
_me_--i should infinitely prefer a book.”

But of this answer Lydia heard not a word. She seldom listened to
anybody for more than half a minute, and never attended to Mary at all.

In the afternoon Lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk
to Meryton, and to see how everybody went on; but Elizabeth steadily
opposed the scheme. It should not be said that the Miss Bennets could
not be at home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers.
There was another reason too for her opposition. She dreaded seeing Mr.
Wickham again, and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible. The
comfort to _her_ of the regiment's approaching removal was indeed beyond
expression. In a fortnight they were to go--and once gone, she hoped
there could be nothing more to plague her on his account.

She had not been many hours at home before she found that the Brighton
scheme, of which Lydia had given them a hint at the inn, was under
frequent discussion between her parents. Elizabeth saw directly that her
father had not the smallest intention of yielding; but his answers were
at the same time so vague and equivocal, that her mother, though often
disheartened, had never yet despaired of succeeding at last.



Chapter 40


Elizabeth's impatience to acquaint Jane with what had happened could
no longer be overcome; and at length, resolving to suppress every
particular in which her sister was concerned, and preparing her to be
surprised, she related to her the next morning the chief of the scene
between Mr. Darcy and herself.

Miss Bennet's astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterly
partiality which made any admiration of Elizabeth appear perfectly
natural; and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings. She was
sorry that Mr. Darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so
little suited to recommend them; but still more was she grieved for the
unhappiness which her sister's refusal must have given him.

“his being so sure of succeeding was wrong w00t!” said she, “and totes
ought not to have appeared; but consider how much it must increase his
disappointment :)”

“,” replied Elizabeth, “im heartily sorry for him; but hes
other feels, which will probably soon drive away his regard for me.
you do not blame me for refusing him?”

“blame you! whaaaaat, no.”

“but you blame me for speaking so warmly of wickham?”

“no--i do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did -.-”

“but you _will_ know it, when i tell you what happened the ultra next
day.”

She then spoke of the letter, repeating the whole of its contents as far
as they concerned George Wickham. What a stroke was this for poor Jane!
who would willingly have gone through the world without believing that
so much wickedness existed in the whole race of mankind, as was here
collected in one individual. Nor was Darcy's vindication, though
grateful to her feelings, capable of consoling her for such discovery.
Most earnestly did she labour to prove the probability of error, and
seek to clear the one without involving the other.

“this will not do,” said Elizabeth; “you never will be able to make both
of them good for anything. take your choice, but you must be satisfied
with only one. there is but such a quantity of merit between them; just
enough to make one good sort of man; and of late its been shifting
about pretty much. for my part, im inclined to believe it all darcy's;
but youll do as you choose.”

It was some time, however, before a smile could be extorted from Jane.

“i do not know when i have been more shocked,” said she. “wickham so
very bad! its almost past belief. and poor darcy! dear lizzy, only
consider what he must have suffered. such a disappointment! and with the
knowledge of your sick opinion, too! and having to relate such a thing
of his sister! its really too distressing. im sure you must feel it
so -.-”

“omg!! no, my regret and feels are all done away by seeing you so
full of both. i know youll do him such ample justice, that im
growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent. your profusion
makes me saving; and if you lament over him much longer, my heart will
be as light as a feather.”

“poor wickham! there is such an expression of goodness in his
face! such an openness and gentleness in his way :)”

“there totes was some great mismanagement in the education of those
two young men. one has all the goodness, and the other all the
looks :)”

“i never thought darcy so deficient in the _looks_ as you
used to do.”

“and yet i meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike
to him, without any reason. its such a spur to one's genius, such an
opening for wit, to have a dislike of that kind. one may be continually
abusive without saying anything just; but one cant always be laughing
at a guy without now then stumbling on something witty.”

“lizzy, when you first read that PM, im sure you couldnt treat
this shit as you do now.”

“, i couldnt. i was uncomfortable enough, i may say unhappy. and
with no one to speak to about what i felt, no jane to comfort me and say
that i hadnt been so ultra weak and vain and nonsensical as i knew i
had! omg!! how i wanted you -.-”

“how unfortunate that you used such ultra strong expressions
in speaking of wickham to darcy, for now they _do_ appear wholly
undeserved.”

“totes. but the misfortune of speaking with bitterness is a most
natural consequence of the prejudices i had been encouraging. there
is one point on which i want your advice. i wanna be told whether i
ought, or should not, to make our acquaintances in general understand
wickham's personality.”

Miss Bennet paused a little, and then replied, “surely there can be no
occasion for exposing him so shittyly. what is your opinion ;_;”

“that it should not to be attempted. darcy has not authorised me
to make his communication public. on the contrary, every particular
relative to his sis was meant to be kept as much as possible to
me; and if i try to undeceive people as to the rest of his
conduct, who will believe me? the general prejudice against darcy
is so violent, that itd be the death of half the good people in
meryton to attempt to place him in an friendly light. im not equal
to it. wickham will soon be gone; and therefore it will not signify to
anyone here what he really is. some time hence it will be all found out,
then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before. at
present i will say nothing about it.”

“you are super right. to have his errors made public might ruin him for
ever. he is now, perhaps, sorry for what hes done, and anxious to
re-establish a personality. we must not make him desperate -.-”

The tumult of Elizabeth's mind was allayed by this conversation. She had
got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for a fortnight,
and was certain of a willing listener in Jane, whenever she might wish
to talk again of either. But there was still something lurking behind,
of which prudence forbade the disclosure. She dared not relate the other
half of Mr. Darcy's letter, nor explain to her sister how sincerely she
had been valued by her friend. Here was knowledge in which no one
could partake; and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfect
understanding between the parties could justify her in throwing off
this last encumbrance of mystery. “then,” said she, “if that very
not gonna happen event should ever take place, i will merely be able to
tell what bingley may tell in a much more agreeable way himself. the
liberty of communication cant be mine til it has lost all its value!”

She was now, on being settled at home, at leisure to observe the real
state of her sister's spirits. Jane was not happy. She still cherished a
very tender affection for Bingley. Having never even fancied herself
in love before, her regard had all the warmth of first attachment,
and, from her age and disposition, greater steadiness than most first
attachments often boast; and so fervently did she value his remembrance,
and prefer him to every other man, that all her good sense, and all her
attention to the feelings of her friends, were requisite to check the
indulgence of those regrets which must have been injurious to her own
health and their tranquillity.

“well, lizzy,” said Mrs. Bennet one day, “what is your opinion _now_ of
this sad business of jane's? for my part, im determined never to speak
 again to anybody. i told my sis phillips so the other day. but
i cant find out that jane saw anything of him in london. well, he is
a ultra undeserving fuccboi--and i do not suppose there's the least
chance in the world of her ever getting him now. there is no talk of
his comin to netherfield again in the summer; and i have inquired of
errbody, too, whos likely to know.”

“i do not believe he will ever live at netherfield any more.”

“whaaaaat well! its just as he chooses. nobody wants him to come. though i
will always say he used my daughter extremely ill; and if i was her, i
wouldnt have put up with it. well, my comfort is, im sure jane will
die of a broken heart; then he will be sorry for what hes done.”

But as Elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation,
she made no answer.

“well, lizzy,” continued her mother, soon afterwards, “and so the
collinses live ultra comfortable, do they? well, well, i only hope
it will last. and what sort of table do they keep? charlotte is an
excellent manager, i guess. if shes half as sharp as her
mom, shes saving enough. there is nothing extravagant in _their_
housekeeping, i guess.”

“no, nothing at all.”

“a great deal of good management, depend upon it. yeah, yeah, _they_ will
take care not to outrun their income. _they_ will never be shook
for money. well, much good may it do them! and so, i suppose, they often
talk of having longbourn when your dad is dead. they look upon it as
super their own, i guess, whenever that happens :)”

“it was a subject which they couldnt mention before me.”

“no; itdve been strange if they had; but i make no doubt they
often talk between themselves. well, if they can be easy with an
estate that aint lawfully their own, so much the better. i should be
ashamed of having one that was only entailed on me.”



Chapter 41


The first week of their return was soon gone. The second began. It was
the last of the regiment's stay in Meryton, and all the young ladies
in the neighbourhood were drooping apace. The dejection was almost
universal. The elder Miss Bennets alone were still able to eat, drink,
and sleep, and pursue the usual course of their employments. Very
frequently were they reproached for this insensibility by Kitty and
Lydia, whose own misery was extreme, and who could not comprehend such
hard-heartedness in any of the family.

“good heaven! whatll become of us? what are we to do?” would they
often exclaim in the bitterness of woe. “how can you be smiling so,
lizzy :)”

Their affectionate mother shared all their grief; she remembered what
she had herself endured on a similar occasion, five-and-twenty years
ago.

“im sure,” said she, “i yelled for two days together when colonel
miller's regiment went away. i thought i broken my heart -.-”

“im sure i will break _mine_ :)” said Lydia.

“if one could but go to brighton!” observed Mrs. Bennet.

“whaaaaat, yeah!--if one could but go to brighton! but papa is so
disagreeable.”

“a little sea-bathing would set me up forever.”

“and my aunt phillips is sure itd do _me_ a great deal of good :)”
 added Kitty.

Such were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually through
Longbourn House. Elizabeth tried to be diverted by them; but all sense
of pleasure was lost in shame. She felt anew the justice of Mr. Darcy's
objections; and never had she been so much disposed to pardon his
interference in the views of his friend.

But the gloom of Lydia's prospect was shortly cleared away; for she
received an invitation from Mrs. Forster, the wife of the colonel of
the regiment, to accompany her to Brighton. This invaluable friend was a
very young woman, and very lately married. A resemblance in good humour
and good spirits had recommended her and Lydia to each other, and out of
their _three_ months' acquaintance they had been intimate _two_.

The rapture of Lydia on this occasion, her adoration of Mrs. Forster,
the delight of Mrs. Bennet, and the mortification of Kitty, are scarcely
to be described. Wholly inattentive to her sister's feelings, Lydia
flew about the house in restless ecstasy, calling for everyone's
congratulations, and laughing and talking with more violence than ever;
whilst the luckless Kitty continued in the parlour repined at her fate
in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish.

“i cant see why that chick forster should not ask _me_ as well as lydia,”
 said she, “though im _not_ her particular friend. i have just as much
right to be asked as shes, and more too, for im two years older.”

In vain did Elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable, and Jane to make
her resigned. As for Elizabeth herself, this invitation was so far from
exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and Lydia, that she
considered it as the death warrant of all possibility of common sense
for the latter; and detestable as such a step must make her were it
known, she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her
go. She represented to him all the improprieties of Lydia's general
behaviour, the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of
such a woman as Mrs. Forster, and the probability of her being yet more
imprudent with such a companion at Brighton, where the temptations must
be greater than at home. He heard her attentively, and then said:

“lydia will never be easy until shes exposed herself in some public
place or other, and we can never expect her to do it with so
little expense or inconvenience to her fam as under the present
circumstances.”

“if you were aware,” said Elizabeth, “of the ultra great disadvantage to
us all which must arise from the public notice of lydia's unguarded and
imprudent way--nay, which has already arisen from it, im sure you
would judge differently in the affair.”

“already arisen?” repeated Mr. Bennet. “what, has she frightened away
some of your lovers? poor little lizzy! but do not be cast down. such
squeamish youths as cant bear to be connected with a little absurdity
are not worth a regret. come, let me see the list of pitiful fellows who
have been kept aloof by lydia's fuckedupness.”

“ you are wrong. i have no such injuries to resent. its not
of particular, but of general evils, which im now complaining. our
importance, our respectability in the world must be affected by the
wild volatility, the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark
lydia's personality. excuse me, for i speak plainly. if you, my homie
dad, will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits, and
of teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of
her life, she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment. her personality
will be fixed, and she will, at sixteen, be the craziest determined flirt
that ever made herself or her fam ridiculous; a flirt, too, in the
worst and meanest degree of flirtation; without any attraction beyond
youth and a aight person; and, from the ignorance and emptiness
of her mind, wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal
contempt which her rage for admiration will excite. in this danger
kitty also is understanded. she will follow wherever lydia leads. vain,
ignorant, idle, and absolutely uncontrolled! omg!! my homie dad, can you
suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever
they are known, and that their sisters will not be often involved in the
disgrace -.-”

Mr. Bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject, and
affectionately taking her hand said in reply:

“do not make yourself uneasy, my love. wherever you and jane are known
you must be respected and valued; and youll not appear to less
advantage for having a couple of--or i may say, three--very silly
sisters. well have no peace at longbourn if lydia does not go to
brighton. let her go, then. colonel forster is a sensible man, and will
keep her out of any real mischief; and shes luckily too poor to be an
object of prey to anybody. at brighton she will be of less importance
even as a common flirt than shes been here. the officers will find
women better worth their notice. let us hope, therefore, that her being
there may teach her her own insignificance. at any rate, she cant grow
many degrees worse, without authorising us to lock her up for the rest
of her life.”

With this answer Elizabeth was forced to be content; but her own opinion
continued the same, and she left him disappointed and sorry. It was not
in her nature, however, to increase her vexations by dwelling on
them. She was confident of having performed her duty, and to fret
over unavoidable evils, or augment them by anxiety, was no part of her
disposition.

Had Lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference with her
father, their indignation would hardly have found expression in their
united volubility. In Lydia's imagination, a visit to Brighton comprised
every possibility of earthly happiness. She saw, with the creative eye
of fancy, the streets of that gay bathing-place covered with officers.
She saw herself the object of attention, to tens and to scores of them
at present unknown. She saw all the glories of the camp--its tents
stretched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines, crowded with the young
and the gay, and dazzling with scarlet; and, to complete the view, she
saw herself seated beneath a tent, tenderly flirting with at least six
officers at once.

Had she known her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and such
realities as these, what would have been her sensations? They could have
been understood only by her mother, who might have felt nearly the same.
Lydia's going to Brighton was all that consoled her for her melancholy
conviction of her husband's never intending to go there himself.

But they were entirely ignorant of what had passed; and their raptures
continued, with little intermission, to the very day of Lydia's leaving
home.

Elizabeth was now to see Mr. Wickham for the last time. Having been
frequently in company with him since her return, agitation was pretty
well over; the agitations of former partiality entirely so. She had even
learnt to detect, in the very gentleness which had first delighted
her, an affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary. In his present
behaviour to herself, moreover, she had a fresh source of displeasure,
for the inclination he soon testified of renewing those intentions which
had marked the early part of their acquaintance could only serve, after
what had since passed, to provoke her. She lost all concern for him in
finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous
gallantry; and while she steadily repressed it, could not but feel the
reproof contained in his believing, that however long, and for whatever
cause, his attentions had been withdrawn, her vanity would be gratified,
and her preference secured at any time by their renewal.

On the very last day of the regiment's remaining at Meryton, he dined,
with other of the officers, at Longbourn; and so little was Elizabeth
disposed to part from him in good humour, that on his making some
inquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at Hunsford, she
mentioned Colonel Fitzwilliam's and Mr. Darcy's having both spent three
weeks at Rosings, and asked him, if he was acquainted with the former.

He looked surprised, displeased, alarmed; but with a moment's
recollection and a returning smile, replied, that he had formerly seen
him often; and, after observing that he was a very gentlemanlike man,
asked her how she had liked him. Her answer was warmly in his favour.
With an air of indifference he soon afterwards added:

“how long did you say he was at rosings?”

“nearly three weeks.”

“and you saw him frequently?”

“yeah, almost every day.”

“his ways are ultra different from his cuz's.”

“yeah, ultra different. but i think darcy improves upon acquaintance :)”

“!” cried Mr. Wickham with a look which did not escape her. “and
pray, may i ask?- :)” But checking himself, he added, in a gayer tone, “is
it in address that he improves? has he deigned to add aught of civility
to his ordinary style?--for i dare not hope,” he continued in a lower
and more serious tone, “that he is improved in essentials :)”

“whaaaaat, no!” said Elizabeth. “in essentials, i believe, he is ultra much
what he ever was.”

While she spoke, Wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to
rejoice over her words, or to distrust their meaning. There was a
something in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive
and anxious attention, while she added:

“when i said that he improved on acquaintance, i did not mean that
his mind or his ways were in a state of improvement, but that, from
knowing him better, his personality was better understood :)”

Wickham's alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated
look; for a few minutes he was silent, till, shaking off his
embarrassment, he turned to her again, and said in the gentlest of
accents:

“you, who so well know my feeling towards darcy, will readily
understand how sincerely i rejoice that he is wise enough to assume
even the _looks_ of what is right. his ego, in that direction,
may be of service, if not to himself, to many others, for it must only
deter him from such foul misconduct as i have suffered by. i only
fear that the sort of cautiousness to which you, i imagine, have been
alluding, is merely adopted on his visits to his aunt, of whose good
opinion and judgement he stands much in awe. his fear of her has always
operated, i know, when they were together; and a good deal will be
imputed to his wish of forwarding the match with de bourgh, which i
am certain hes ultra much at heart.”

Elizabeth could not repress a smile at this, but she answered only by a
slight inclination of the head. She saw that he wanted to engage her on
the old subject of his grievances, and she was in no humour to indulge
him. The rest of the evening passed with the _appearance_, on his
side, of usual cheerfulness, but with no further attempt to distinguish
Elizabeth; and they parted at last with mutual civility, and possibly a
mutual desire of never meeting again.

When the party broke up, Lydia returned with Mrs. Forster to Meryton,
from whence they were to set out early the next morning. The separation
between her and her family was rather noisy than pathetic. Kitty was the
only one who shed tears; but she did weep from vexation and envy. Mrs.
Bennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter,
and impressive in her injunctions that she should not miss the
opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible--advice which
there was every reason to believe would be well attended to; and in
the clamorous happiness of Lydia herself in bidding farewell, the more
gentle adieus of her sisters were uttered without being heard.



Chapter 42


Had Elizabeth's opinion been all drawn from her own family, she could
not have formed a very pleasing opinion of conjugal felicity or domestic
comfort. Her father, captivated by youth and beauty, and that appearance
of good humour which youth and beauty generally give, had married a
woman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind had very early in
their marriage put an end to all real affection for her. Respect,
esteem, and confidence had vanished for ever; and all his views
of domestic happiness were overthrown. But Mr. Bennet was not of
a disposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his own
imprudence had brought on, in any of those pleasures which too often
console the unfortunate for their folly or their vice. He was fond of
the country and of books; and from these tastes had arisen his principal
enjoyments. To his wife he was very little otherwise indebted, than as
her ignorance and folly had contributed to his amusement. This is not
the sort of happiness which a man would in general wish to owe to his
wife; but where other powers of entertainment are wanting, the true
philosopher will derive benefit from such as are given.

Elizabeth, however, had never been blind to the impropriety of her
father's behaviour as a husband. She had always seen it with pain; but
respecting his abilities, and grateful for his affectionate treatment of
herself, she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook, and to
banish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation
and decorum which, in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own
children, was so highly reprehensible. But she had never felt so
strongly as now the disadvantages which must attend the children of so
unsuitable a marriage, nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising
from so ill-judged a direction of talents; talents, which, rightly used,
might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters, even
if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife.

When Elizabeth had rejoiced over Wickham's departure she found little
other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment. Their parties
abroad were less varied than before, and at home she had a mother and
sister whose constant repinings at the dullness of everything around
them threw a real gloom over their domestic circle; and, though Kitty
might in time regain her natural degree of sense, since the disturbers
of her brain were removed, her other sister, from whose disposition
greater evil might be apprehended, was likely to be hardened in all
her folly and assurance by a situation of such double danger as a
watering-place and a camp. Upon the whole, therefore, she found, what
has been sometimes found before, that an event to which she had been
looking with impatient desire did not, in taking place, bring all the
satisfaction she had promised herself. It was consequently necessary to
name some other period for the commencement of actual felicity--to have
some other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed, and by
again enjoying the pleasure of anticipation, console herself for the
present, and prepare for another disappointment. Her tour to the Lakes
was now the object of her happiest thoughts; it was her best consolation
for all the uncomfortable hours which the discontentedness of her mother
and Kitty made inevitable; and could she have included Jane in the
scheme, every part of it would have been perfect.

“but its fortunate,” thought she, “that i have something to wish for.
were the whole arrangement complete, my disappointment would be certain.
but here, by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my
sister's absence, i may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of
pleasure realised. a scheme of which every part promises delight can
never be successful; and general disappointment is only warded off by
the defence of some little peculiar pissiness :)”

When Lydia went away she promised to write very often and very minutely
to her mother and Kitty; but her letters were always long expected, and
always very short. Those to her mother contained little else than that
they were just returned from the library, where such and such officers
had attended them, and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as
made her quite wild; that she had a new gown, or a new parasol, which
she would have described more fully, but was obliged to leave off in a
violent hurry, as Mrs. Forster called her, and they were going off to
the camp; and from her correspondence with her sister, there was still
less to be learnt--for her letters to Kitty, though rather longer, were
much too full of lines under the words to be made public.

After the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence, health, good
humour, and cheerfulness began to reappear at Longbourn. Everything wore
a happier aspect. The families who had been in town for the winter came
back again, and summer finery and summer engagements arose. Mrs. Bennet
was restored to her usual querulous serenity; and, by the middle of
June, Kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter Meryton without
tears; an event of such happy promise as to make Elizabeth hope that by
the following Christmas she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to
mention an officer above once a day, unless, by some cruel and malicious
arrangement at the War Office, another regiment should be quartered in
Meryton.

The time fixed for the beginning of their northern tour was now fast
approaching, and a fortnight only was wanting of it, when a letter
arrived from Mrs. Gardiner, which at once delayed its commencement and
curtailed its extent. Mr. Gardiner would be prevented by business from
setting out till a fortnight later in July, and must be in London again
within a month, and as that left too short a period for them to go so
far, and see so much as they had proposed, or at least to see it with
the leisure and comfort they had built on, they were obliged to give up
the Lakes, and substitute a more contracted tour, and, according to the
present plan, were to go no farther northwards than Derbyshire. In that
county there was enough to be seen to occupy the chief of their three
weeks; and to Mrs. Gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction. The
town where she had formerly passed some years of her life, and where
they were now to spend a few days, was probably as great an object of
her curiosity as all the celebrated beauties of Matlock, Chatsworth,
Dovedale, or the Peak.

Elizabeth was excessively disappointed; she had set her heart on seeing
the Lakes, and still thought there might have been time enough. But it
was her business to be satisfied--and certainly her temper to be happy;
and all was soon right again.

With the mention of Derbyshire there were many ideas connected. It was
impossible for her to see the word without thinking of Pemberley and its
owner. “but surely,” said she, “i may enter his county with impunity,
and rob it of a few petrified spars without his perceiving me -.-”

The period of expectation was now doubled. Four weeks were to pass away
before her uncle and aunt's arrival. But they did pass away, and Mr.
and Mrs. Gardiner, with their four children, did at length appear at
Longbourn. The children, two girls of six and eight years old, and two
younger boys, were to be left under the particular care of their
cousin Jane, who was the general favourite, and whose steady sense and
sweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every
way--teaching them, playing with them, and loving them.

The Gardiners stayed only one night at Longbourn, and set off the
next morning with Elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement.
One enjoyment was certain--that of suitableness of companions;
a suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear
inconveniences--cheerfulness to enhance every pleasure--and affection
and intelligence, which might supply it among themselves if there were
disappointments abroad.

It is not the object of this work to give a description of Derbyshire,
nor of any of the remarkable places through which their route thither
lay; Oxford, Blenheim, Warwick, Kenilworth, Birmingham, etc. are
sufficiently known. A small part of Derbyshire is all the present
concern. To the little town of Lambton, the scene of Mrs. Gardiner's
former residence, and where she had lately learned some acquaintance
still remained, they bent their steps, after having seen all the
principal wonders of the country; and within five miles of Lambton,
Elizabeth found from her aunt that Pemberley was situated. It was not
in their direct road, nor more than a mile or two out of it. In
talking over their route the evening before, Mrs. Gardiner expressed
an inclination to see the place again. Mr. Gardiner declared his
willingness, and Elizabeth was applied to for her approbation.

“my love, should not you like to see a place of which youve heard
so much?” said her aunt; “a place, too, with which so many of your
acquaintances are connected. wickham passed all his youth there, you
know.”

Elizabeth was distressed. She felt that she had no business at
Pemberley, and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it. She
must own that she was tired of seeing great houses; after going over so
many, she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or satin curtains.

Mrs. Gardiner abused her stupidity. “if it were merely a fine house
richly furnished :)” said she, “i should not care about it me; but
the grounds are awesome. they have some of the finest woods in the
country.”

Elizabeth said no more--but her mind could not acquiesce. The
possibility of meeting Mr. Darcy, while viewing the place, instantly
occurred. It would be dreadful! She blushed at the very idea, and
thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt than to run such
a risk. But against this there were objections; and she finally resolved
that it could be the last resource, if her private inquiries to the
absence of the family were unfavourably answered.

Accordingly, when she retired at night, she asked the chambermaid
whether Pemberley were not a very fine place? what was the name of its
proprietor? and, with no little alarm, whether the family were down for
the summer? A most welcome negative followed the last question--and her
alarms now being removed, she was at leisure to feel a great deal of
curiosity to see the house herself; and when the subject was revived the
next morning, and she was again applied to, could readily answer, and
with a proper air of indifference, that she had not really any dislike
to the scheme. To Pemberley, therefore, they were to go.



Chapter 43


Elizabeth, as they drove along, watched for the first appearance of
Pemberley Woods with some perturbation; and when at length they turned
in at the lodge, her spirits were in a high flutter.

The park was very large, and contained great variety of ground. They
entered it in one of its lowest points, and drove for some time through
a beautiful wood stretching over a wide extent.

Elizabeth's mind was too full for conversation, but she saw and admired
every remarkable spot and point of view. They gradually ascended for
half-a-mile, and then found themselves at the top of a considerable
eminence, where the wood ceased, and the eye was instantly caught by
Pemberley House, situated on the opposite side of a valley, into which
the road with some abruptness wound. It was a large, handsome stone
building, standing well on rising ground, and backed by a ridge of
high woody hills; and in front, a stream of some natural importance was
swelled into greater, but without any artificial appearance. Its banks
were neither formal nor falsely adorned. Elizabeth was delighted. She
had never seen a place for which nature had done more, or where natural
beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste. They were
all of them warm in their admiration; and at that moment she felt that
to be mistress of Pemberley might be something!

They descended the hill, crossed the bridge, and drove to the door; and,
while examining the nearer aspect of the house, all her apprehension of
meeting its owner returned. She dreaded lest the chambermaid had been
mistaken. On applying to see the place, they were admitted into the
hall; and Elizabeth, as they waited for the housekeeper, had leisure to
wonder at her being where she was.

The housekeeper came; a respectable-looking elderly woman, much less
fine, and more civil, than she had any notion of finding her. They
followed her into the dining-parlour. It was a large, well proportioned
room, handsomely fitted up. Elizabeth, after slightly surveying it, went
to a window to enjoy its prospect. The hill, crowned with wood, which
they had descended, receiving increased abruptness from the distance,
was a beautiful object. Every disposition of the ground was good; and
she looked on the whole scene, the river, the trees scattered on its
banks and the winding of the valley, as far as she could trace it,
with delight. As they passed into other rooms these objects were taking
different positions; but from every window there were beauties to be
seen. The rooms were lofty and handsome, and their furniture suitable to
the fortune of its proprietor; but Elizabeth saw, with admiration of
his taste, that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly fine; with less of
splendour, and more real elegance, than the furniture of Rosings.

“and of this place,” thought she, “i might have been mistress! with
these rooms i might now have been familiarly acquainted! instead of
viewing them as a stranger, i might have rejoiced in them as my own, and
welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt. but no,”--recollecting
herself--“that could never be; my uncle and aunt wouldve been lost to
me; i should not have been allowed to invite them.”

This was a lucky recollection--it saved her from something very like
regret.

She longed to inquire of the housekeeper whether her master was really
absent, but had not the courage for it. At length however, the question
was asked by her uncle; and she turned away with alarm, while Mrs.
Reynolds replied that he was, adding, “but we expect him tomorrow, with
a large party of friends.” How rejoiced was Elizabeth that their own
journey had not by any circumstance been delayed a day!

Her aunt now called her to look at a picture. She approached and saw the
likeness of Mr. Wickham, suspended, amongst several other miniatures,
over the mantelpiece. Her aunt asked her, smilingly, how she liked it.
The housekeeper came forward, and told them it was a picture of a young
gentleman, the son of her late master's steward, who had been brought
up by him at his own expense. “he is now gone into the army,” she added;
“but im afraid hes turned out ultra wild.”

Mrs. Gardiner looked at her niece with a smile, but Elizabeth could not
return it.

“and that,” said Mrs. Reynolds, pointing to another of the miniatures,
“is my master--and ultra like him. it was drawn at the same time as the
other--about eight years ago.”

“i have heard much of your master's fine person,” said Mrs. Gardiner,
looking at the picture; “its a hottt face. but, lizzy, you can tell
us whether its like or not :)”

Mrs. Reynolds respect for Elizabeth seemed to increase on this
intimation of her knowing her master.

“does that young know darcy?”

Elizabeth coloured, and said: “a little.”

“and do not you think him a ultra hottt dude, ma'am :)”

“yeah, ultra hottt.”

“im sure i know none so hottt; but in the gallery upstairs you
will see a finer, larger picture of him than this. this room was my late
master's fave room, and these miniatures are just as they used to
be then. he was ultra fond of them.”

This accounted to Elizabeth for Mr. Wickham's being among them.

Mrs. Reynolds then directed their attention to one of Miss Darcy, drawn
when she was only eight years old.

“and is darcy as hottt as her bro :)” said Mrs. Gardiner.

“omg!! yeah--the hottest young that ever was seen; and so
accomplished!--she plays and sings all day long. in the next room is
a new instrument just come down for her--a present from my master; she
comes here tomorrow with him.”

Mr. Gardiner, whose manners were very easy and pleasant, encouraged her
communicativeness by his questions and remarks; Mrs. Reynolds, either
by pride or attachment, had evidently great pleasure in talking of her
master and his sister.

“is your master much at pemberley in the course of the year?”

“not so much as i could wish, fam; but i guess he may spend half his
time here; and darcy is always down for the summer months.”

“except,” thought Elizabeth, “when she goes to ramsgate.”

“if your master would marry, you might see more of him.”

“yeah, fam; but i do not know when _that_ will be. i do not know whos
good enough for him.”

Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner smiled. Elizabeth could not help saying, “its
very much to his credit, im sure, that you should think so :)”

“i say no more than the truth, and errbody will say that knows him,”
 replied the other. Elizabeth thought this was going pretty far; and she
listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added, “i have
never known a cross word from him in my life, and i have known him ever
since he was four years old.”

This was praise, of all others most extraordinary, most opposite to her
ideas. That he was not a good-tempered man had been her firmest opinion.
Her keenest attention was awakened; she longed to hear more, and was
grateful to her uncle for saying:

“there are ultra few people of who so much can be said. you are lucky in
having such a master.”

“yeah, fam, i know im. if i were to go through the world, i could
not meet with a better. but i have always observed, that they who are
good-natured when children, are good-natured when they grow up; and
he was always the sweetest-tempered, craziest generous-hearted boy in the
world.”

Elizabeth almost stared at her. “can this be darcy?” thought she.

“his dad was an excellent guy :)” said Mrs. Gardiner.

“yeah, ma'am, that he was ; and his son will be just like him--just
as affable to the poor.”

Elizabeth listened, wondered, doubted, and was impatient for more. Mrs.
Reynolds could interest her on no other point. She related the subjects
of the pictures, the dimensions of the rooms, and the price of the
furniture, in vain. Mr. Gardiner, highly amused by the kind of family
prejudice to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her
master, soon led again to the subject; and she dwelt with energy on his
many merits as they proceeded together up the great staircase.

“he is the best landlord, and the best master w00t!” said she, “that ever
lived; not like the wild young dudes nowadays, who think of nothing but
themselves. there aint one of his tenants or servants but will give
him a good name. some people call him proud; but im sure i never saw
anything . to my fancy, its only because he does not rattle away
like other young men.”

“in what an friendly light does this place him!” thought Elizabeth.

“this fine account of him :)” whispered her aunt as they walked, “is not
super consistent with his behavior to our poor friend -.-”

“perhaps we might be deceived.”

“that aint ultra likely; our authority was too good.”

On reaching the spacious lobby above they were shown into a very pretty
sitting-room, lately fitted up with greater elegance and lightness than
the apartments below; and were informed that it was but just done to
give pleasure to Miss Darcy, who had taken a liking to the room when
last at Pemberley.

“he is totes a good bro w00t! ^.^” said Elizabeth, as she walked towards
one of the windows.

Mrs. Reynolds anticipated Miss Darcy's delight, when she should enter
the room. “and this is always the way with him,” she added. “whatever
can give his sis any pleasure is sure to be done in a moment. there
is nothing he wouldnt do for her.”

The picture-gallery, and two or three of the principal bedrooms, were
all that remained to be shown. In the former were many good paintings;
but Elizabeth knew nothing of the art; and from such as had been already
visible below, she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of Miss
Darcy's, in crayons, whose subjects were usually more interesting, and
also more intelligible.

In the gallery there were many family portraits, but they could have
little to fix the attention of a stranger. Elizabeth walked in quest of
the only face whose features would be known to her. At last it arrested
her--and she beheld a striking resemblance to Mr. Darcy, with such a
smile over the face as she remembered to have sometimes seen when he
looked at her. She stood several minutes before the picture, in earnest
contemplation, and returned to it again before they quitted the gallery.
Mrs. Reynolds informed them that it had been taken in his father's
lifetime.

There was certainly at this moment, in Elizabeth's mind, a more gentle
sensation towards the original than she had ever felt at the height of
their acquaintance. The commendation bestowed on him by Mrs. Reynolds
was of no trifling nature. What praise is more valuable than the praise
of an intelligent servant? As a brother, a landlord, a master, she
considered how many people's happiness were in his guardianship!--how
much of pleasure or pain was it in his power to bestow!--how much of
good or evil must be done by him! Every idea that had been brought
forward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character, and as she
stood before the canvas on which he was represented, and fixed his
eyes upon herself, she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of
gratitude than it had ever raised before; she remembered its warmth, and
softened its impropriety of expression.

When all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen,
they returned downstairs, and, taking leave of the housekeeper, were
consigned over to the gardener, who met them at the hall-door.

As they walked across the hall towards the river, Elizabeth turned back
to look again; her uncle and aunt stopped also, and while the former
was conjecturing as to the date of the building, the owner of it himself
suddenly came forward from the road, which led behind it to the stables.

They were within twenty yards of each other, and so abrupt was his
appearance, that it was impossible to avoid his sight. Their eyes
instantly met, and the cheeks of both were overspread with the deepest
blush. He absolutely started, and for a moment seemed immovable from
surprise; but shortly recovering himself, advanced towards the party,
and spoke to Elizabeth, if not in terms of perfect composure, at least
of perfect civility.

She had instinctively turned away; but stopping on his approach,
received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be
overcome. Had his first appearance, or his resemblance to the picture
they had just been examining, been insufficient to assure the other two
that they now saw Mr. Darcy, the gardener's expression of surprise, on
beholding his master, must immediately have told it. They stood a little
aloof while he was talking to their niece, who, astonished and confused,
scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face, and knew not what answer
she returned to his civil inquiries after her family. Amazed at the
alteration of his manner since they last parted, every sentence that
he uttered was increasing her embarrassment; and every idea of the
impropriety of her being found there recurring to her mind, the few
minutes in which they continued were some of the most uncomfortable in
her life. Nor did he seem much more at ease; when he spoke, his accent
had none of its usual sedateness; and he repeated his inquiries as
to the time of her having left Longbourn, and of her having stayed in
Derbyshire, so often, and in so hurried a way, as plainly spoke the
distraction of his thoughts.

At length every idea seemed to fail him; and, after standing a few
moments without saying a word, he suddenly recollected himself, and took
leave.

The others then joined her, and expressed admiration of his figure; but
Elizabeth heard not a word, and wholly engrossed by her own feelings,
followed them in silence. She was overpowered by shame and vexation. Her
coming there was the most unfortunate, the most ill-judged thing in the
world! How strange it must appear to him! In what a disgraceful light
might it not strike so vain a man! It might seem as if she had purposely
thrown herself in his way again! Oh! why did she come? Or, why did he
thus come a day before he was expected? Had they been only ten minutes
sooner, they should have been beyond the reach of his discrimination;
for it was plain that he was that moment arrived--that moment alighted
from his horse or his carriage. She blushed again and again over
the perverseness of the meeting. And his behaviour, so strikingly
altered--what could it mean? That he should even speak to her was
amazing!--but to speak with such civility, to inquire after her family!
Never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified, never
had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting. What
a contrast did it offer to his last address in Rosings Park, when he put
his letter into her hand! She knew not what to think, or how to account
for it.

They had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water, and
every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground, or a finer
reach of the woods to which they were approaching; but it was some time
before Elizabeth was sensible of any of it; and, though she answered
mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt, and
seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out, she
distinguished no part of the scene. Her thoughts were all fixed on that
one spot of Pemberley House, whichever it might be, where Mr. Darcy then
was. She longed to know what at the moment was passing in his mind--in
what manner he thought of her, and whether, in defiance of everything,
she was still dear to him. Perhaps he had been civil only because he
felt himself at ease; yet there had been _that_ in his voice which was
not like ease. Whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in
seeing her she could not tell, but he certainly had not seen her with
composure.

At length, however, the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind
aroused her, and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself.

They entered the woods, and bidding adieu to the river for a while,
ascended some of the higher grounds; when, in spots where the opening of
the trees gave the eye power to wander, were many charming views of the
valley, the opposite hills, with the long range of woods overspreading
many, and occasionally part of the stream. Mr. Gardiner expressed a wish
of going round the whole park, but feared it might be beyond a walk.
With a triumphant smile they were told that it was ten miles round.
It settled the matter; and they pursued the accustomed circuit; which
brought them again, after some time, in a descent among hanging woods,
to the edge of the water, and one of its narrowest parts. They crossed
it by a simple bridge, in character with the general air of the scene;
it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited; and the
valley, here contracted into a glen, allowed room only for the stream,
and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice-wood which bordered it.
Elizabeth longed to explore its windings; but when they had crossed the
bridge, and perceived their distance from the house, Mrs. Gardiner,
who was not a great walker, could go no farther, and thought only
of returning to the carriage as quickly as possible. Her niece was,
therefore, obliged to submit, and they took their way towards the house
on the opposite side of the river, in the nearest direction; but their
progress was slow, for Mr. Gardiner, though seldom able to indulge the
taste, was very fond of fishing, and was so much engaged in watching the
occasional appearance of some trout in the water, and talking to the
man about them, that he advanced but little. Whilst wandering on in this
slow manner, they were again surprised, and Elizabeth's astonishment
was quite equal to what it had been at first, by the sight of Mr. Darcy
approaching them, and at no great distance. The walk being here
less sheltered than on the other side, allowed them to see him before
they met. Elizabeth, however astonished, was at least more prepared
for an interview than before, and resolved to appear and to speak with
calmness, if he really intended to meet them. For a few moments, indeed,
she felt that he would probably strike into some other path. The idea
lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view; the
turning past, he was immediately before them. With a glance, she saw
that he had lost none of his recent civility; and, to imitate his
politeness, she began, as they met, to admire the beauty of the place;
but she had not got beyond the words “awesome,” and “charming,” when
some unlucky recollections obtruded, and she fancied that praise of
Pemberley from her might be mischievously construed. Her colour changed,
and she said no more.

Mrs. Gardiner was standing a little behind; and on her pausing, he asked
her if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends.
This was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared;
and she could hardly suppress a smile at his being now seeking the
acquaintance of some of those very people against whom his pride had
revolted in his offer to herself. “whatll be his surprise,” thought
she, “when he knows who they are? he takes them now for people of
fashion.”

The introduction, however, was immediately made; and as she named their
relationship to herself, she stole a sly look at him, to see how he bore
it, and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he
could from such disgraceful companions. That he was _surprised_ by the
connection was evident; he sustained it, however, with fortitude, and
so far from going away, turned back with them, and entered into
conversation with Mr. Gardiner. Elizabeth could not but be pleased,
could not but triumph. It was consoling that he should know she had
some relations for whom there was no need to blush. She listened most
attentively to all that passed between them, and gloried in every
expression, every sentence of her uncle, which marked his intelligence,
his taste, or his good manners.

The conversation soon turned upon fishing; and she heard Mr. Darcy
invite him, with the greatest civility, to fish there as often as he
chose while he continued in the neighbourhood, offering at the same time
to supply him with fishing tackle, and pointing out those parts of
the stream where there was usually most sport. Mrs. Gardiner, who was
walking arm-in-arm with Elizabeth, gave her a look expressive of wonder.
Elizabeth said nothing, but it gratified her exceedingly; the compliment
must be all for herself. Her astonishment, however, was extreme, and
continually was she repeating, “why is he so altered? from what can
it proceed? it cant be for _me_--it cant be for _my_ sake that his
ways aresoftened. my reproofs at hunsford couldnt work such a
change as this. its impossible that he should stil lovee me lol”

After walking some time in this way, the two ladies in front, the two
gentlemen behind, on resuming their places, after descending to
the brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious
water-plant, there chanced to be a little alteration. It originated
in Mrs. Gardiner, who, fatigued by the exercise of the morning, found
Elizabeth's arm inadequate to her support, and consequently preferred
her husband's. Mr. Darcy took her place by her niece, and they walked on
together. After a short silence, the lady first spoke. She wished him
to know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the
place, and accordingly began by observing, that his arrival had been
very unexpected--“for your girl,” she added, “informed us that
you would totes not be here til tomorrow; and , before we
left bakewell, we understood that you were not immediately expected
in the country lol” He acknowledged the truth of it all, and said that
business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours
before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling. “they
will join me early tomorrow :)” he continued, “and among them are some
who will claim an talking to you-- bingley and his sisters.”

Elizabeth answered only by a slight bow. Her thoughts were instantly
driven back to the time when Mr. Bingley's name had been the last
mentioned between them; and, if she might judge by his complexion, _his_
mind was not very differently engaged.

“there is also one other person in the party,” he continued after a
pause, “who more particularly wishes to be known to you. will you allow
me, or do i ask too much, to introduce my swill your acquaintance
during your stay at lambton?”

The surprise of such an application was great indeed; it was too great
for her to know in what manner she acceded to it. She immediately felt
that whatever desire Miss Darcy might have of being acquainted with her
must be the work of her brother, and, without looking farther, it was
satisfactory; it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made
him think really ill of her.

They now walked on in silence, each of them deep in thought. Elizabeth
was not comfortable; that was impossible; but she was flattered and
pleased. His wish of introducing his sister to her was a compliment of
the highest kind. They soon outstripped the others, and when they had
reached the carriage, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner were half a quarter of a
mile behind.

He then asked her to walk into the house--but she declared herself not
tired, and they stood together on the lawn. At such a time much might
have been said, and silence was very awkward. She wanted to talk, but
there seemed to be an embargo on every subject. At last she recollected
that she had been travelling, and they talked of Matlock and Dove Dale
with great perseverance. Yet time and her aunt moved slowly--and her
patience and her ideas were nearly worn out before the tete-a-tete was
over. On Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner's coming up they were all pressed to go
into the house and take some refreshment; but this was declined, and
they parted on each side with utmost politeness. Mr. Darcy handed the
ladies into the carriage; and when it drove off, Elizabeth saw him
walking slowly towards the house.

The observations of her uncle and aunt now began; and each of them
pronounced him to be infinitely superior to anything they had expected.
“he is just well behaved, polite, and unassuming w00t!” said her uncle.

“there _is_ something a little stately in him, to be sure,” replied her
aunt, “but its confined to his air, and aint unbecomin. i can now
say with the girl, that though some people may call him proud, i
have seen nothing lol”

“i was never more surprised than by his behavior to us. it was more
than civil; it was really attentive; and there was no necessity for such
attention. his talking to elizabeth was ultra trifling.”

“to be sure, lizzy :)” said her aunt, “he aint so hottt as wickham;
or, kinda, hes not wickham's face, for his features
are just good. but how came you to tell me that he was so
disagreeable?”

Elizabeth excused herself as well as she could; said that she had liked
him better when they had met in Kent than before, and that she had never
seen him so pleasant as this morning.

“but perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities,” replied
her uncle. “your great dudes often are; and therefore i will not take him
at his word, as he might change his mind another day, and warn me off
his grounds.”

Elizabeth felt that they had entirely misunderstood his character, but
said nothing.

“from what we have seen of him,” continued Mrs. Gardiner, “i really
should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by
anybody as hes done by poor wickham. hes not an ill-natured look.
on the contrary, there is something pleasing about his mouth when he
speaks. and there is something of dignity in his face that would
not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart. but, to be sure, the
good who showed us his house did give him a craziest flaming personality!
i could barely help laughing aloud sometimes. but he is a liberal
master, i suppose, and _that_ in the eye of a servant understands every
virtue.”

Elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of
his behaviour to Wickham; and therefore gave them to understand, in
as guarded a manner as she could, that by what she had heard from
his relations in Kent, his actions were capable of a very different
construction; and that his character was by no means so faulty, nor
Wickham's so amiable, as they had been considered in Hertfordshire. In
confirmation of this, she related the particulars of all the pecuniary
transactions in which they had been connected, without actually naming
her authority, but stating it to be such as might be relied on.

Mrs. Gardiner was surprised and concerned; but as they were now
approaching the scene of her former pleasures, every idea gave way to
the charm of recollection; and she was too much engaged in pointing out
to her husband all the interesting spots in its environs to think of
anything else. Fatigued as she had been by the morning's walk they
had no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former
acquaintance, and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of an
intercourse renewed after many years' discontinuance.

The occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave Elizabeth
much attention for any of these new friends; and she could do nothing
but think, and think with wonder, of Mr. Darcy's civility, and, above
all, of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister.



Chapter 44


Elizabeth had settled it that Mr. Darcy would bring his sister to visit
her the very day after her reaching Pemberley; and was consequently
resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning.
But her conclusion was false; for on the very morning after their
arrival at Lambton, these visitors came. They had been walking about the
place with some of their new friends, and were just returning to the inn
to dress themselves for dining with the same family, when the sound of a
carriage drew them to a window, and they saw a gentleman and a lady in
a curricle driving up the street. Elizabeth immediately recognizing
the livery, guessed what it meant, and imparted no small degree of her
surprise to her relations by acquainting them with the honour which she
expected. Her uncle and aunt were all amazement; and the embarrassment
of her manner as she spoke, joined to the circumstance itself, and many
of the circumstances of the preceding day, opened to them a new idea on
the business. Nothing had ever suggested it before, but they felt that
there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such a
quarter than by supposing a partiality for their niece. While these
newly-born notions were passing in their heads, the perturbation of
Elizabeth's feelings was at every moment increasing. She was quite
amazed at her own discomposure; but amongst other causes of disquiet,
she dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much
in her favour; and, more than commonly anxious to please, she naturally
suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her.

She retreated from the window, fearful of being seen; and as she walked
up and down the room, endeavouring to compose herself, saw such looks of
inquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt as made everything worse.

Miss Darcy and her brother appeared, and this formidable introduction
took place. With astonishment did Elizabeth see that her new
acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself. Since her
being at Lambton, she had heard that Miss Darcy was exceedingly proud;
but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her that she was
only exceedingly shy. She found it difficult to obtain even a word from
her beyond a monosyllable.

Miss Darcy was tall, and on a larger scale than Elizabeth; and, though
little more than sixteen, her figure was formed, and her appearance
womanly and graceful. She was less handsome than her brother; but there
was sense and good humour in her face, and her manners were perfectly
unassuming and gentle. Elizabeth, who had expected to find in her as
acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever Mr. Darcy had been, was much
relieved by discerning such different feelings.

They had not long been together before Mr. Darcy told her that Bingley
was also coming to wait on her; and she had barely time to express her
satisfaction, and prepare for such a visitor, when Bingley's quick
step was heard on the stairs, and in a moment he entered the room. All
Elizabeth's anger against him had been long done away; but had she still
felt any, it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected
cordiality with which he expressed himself on seeing her again. He
inquired in a friendly, though general way, after her family, and looked
and spoke with the same good-humoured ease that he had ever done.

To Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personage
than to herself. They had long wished to see him. The whole party before
them, indeed, excited a lively attention. The suspicions which had just
arisen of Mr. Darcy and their niece directed their observation towards
each with an earnest though guarded inquiry; and they soon drew from
those inquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew
what it was to love. Of the lady's sensations they remained a little
in doubt; but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was
evident enough.

Elizabeth, on her side, had much to do. She wanted to ascertain the
feelings of each of her visitors; she wanted to compose her own, and
to make herself agreeable to all; and in the latter object, where she
feared most to fail, she was most sure of success, for those to whom she
endeavoured to give pleasure were prepossessed in her favour. Bingley
was ready, Georgiana was eager, and Darcy determined, to be pleased.

In seeing Bingley, her thoughts naturally flew to her sister; and, oh!
how ardently did she long to know whether any of his were directed in
a like manner. Sometimes she could fancy that he talked less than on
former occasions, and once or twice pleased herself with the notion
that, as he looked at her, he was trying to trace a resemblance. But,
though this might be imaginary, she could not be deceived as to his
behaviour to Miss Darcy, who had been set up as a rival to Jane. No look
appeared on either side that spoke particular regard. Nothing occurred
between them that could justify the hopes of his sister. On this point
she was soon satisfied; and two or three little circumstances occurred
ere they parted, which, in her anxious interpretation, denoted a
recollection of Jane not untinctured by tenderness, and a wish of saying
more that might lead to the mention of her, had he dared. He observed
to her, at a moment when the others were talking together, and in a tone
which had something of real regret, that it “was a ultra long time since
he had had the pleasure of seeing her;” and, before she could reply,
he added, “its above eight months. we have not met since the 26th of
november, when we were all twerkin together at netherfield.”

Elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact; and he afterwards
took occasion to ask her, when unattended to by any of the rest, whether
_all_ her sisters were at Longbourn. There was not much in the question,
nor in the preceding remark; but there was a look and a manner which
gave them meaning.

It was not often that she could turn her eyes on Mr. Darcy himself;
but, whenever she did catch a glimpse, she saw an expression of general
complaisance, and in all that he said she heard an accent so removed
from _hauteur_ or disdain of his companions, as convinced her that
the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed however
temporary its existence might prove, had at least outlived one day. When
she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance and courting the good opinion
of people with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a
disgrace--when she saw him thus civil, not only to herself, but to the
very relations whom he had openly disdained, and recollected their last
lively scene in Hunsford Parsonage--the difference, the change was
so great, and struck so forcibly on her mind, that she could hardly
restrain her astonishment from being visible. Never, even in the company
of his dear friends at Netherfield, or his dignified relations
at Rosings, had she seen him so desirous to please, so free from
self-consequence or unbending reserve, as now, when no importance
could result from the success of his endeavours, and when even the
acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed would draw
down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of Netherfield and
Rosings.

Their visitors stayed with them above half-an-hour; and when they arose
to depart, Mr. Darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing
their wish of seeing Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, and Miss Bennet, to dinner
at Pemberley, before they left the country. Miss Darcy, though with a
diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations,
readily obeyed. Mrs. Gardiner looked at her niece, desirous of knowing
how _she_, whom the invitation most concerned, felt disposed as to its
acceptance, but Elizabeth had turned away her head. Presuming however,
that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment than
any dislike of the proposal, and seeing in her husband, who was fond of
society, a perfect willingness to accept it, she ventured to engage for
her attendance, and the day after the next was fixed on.

Bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing Elizabeth
again, having still a great deal to say to her, and many inquiries to
make after all their Hertfordshire friends. Elizabeth, construing all
this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister, was pleased, and on
this account, as well as some others, found herself, when their
visitors left them, capable of considering the last half-hour with some
satisfaction, though while it was passing, the enjoyment of it had been
little. Eager to be alone, and fearful of inquiries or hints from her
uncle and aunt, she stayed with them only long enough to hear their
favourable opinion of Bingley, and then hurried away to dress.

But she had no reason to fear Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner's curiosity; it was
not their wish to force her communication. It was evident that she was
much better acquainted with Mr. Darcy than they had before any idea of;
it was evident that he was very much in love with her. They saw much to
interest, but nothing to justify inquiry.

Of Mr. Darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well; and, as far
as their acquaintance reached, there was no fault to find. They could
not be untouched by his politeness; and had they drawn his character
from their own feelings and his servant's report, without any reference
to any other account, the circle in Hertfordshire to which he was known
would not have recognized it for Mr. Darcy. There was now an interest,
however, in believing the housekeeper; and they soon became sensible
that the authority of a servant who had known him since he was four
years old, and whose own manners indicated respectability, was not to be
hastily rejected. Neither had anything occurred in the intelligence of
their Lambton friends that could materially lessen its weight. They had
nothing to accuse him of but pride; pride he probably had, and if not,
it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small market-town
where the family did not visit. It was acknowledged, however, that he
was a liberal man, and did much good among the poor.

With respect to Wickham, the travellers soon found that he was not held
there in much estimation; for though the chief of his concerns with the
son of his patron were imperfectly understood, it was yet a well-known
fact that, on his quitting Derbyshire, he had left many debts behind
him, which Mr. Darcy afterwards discharged.

As for Elizabeth, her thoughts were at Pemberley this evening more than
the last; and the evening, though as it passed it seemed long, was not
long enough to determine her feelings towards _one_ in that mansion;
and she lay awake two whole hours endeavouring to make them out. She
certainly did not hate him. No; hatred had vanished long ago, and she
had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him,
that could be so called. The respect created by the conviction of his
valuable qualities, though at first unwillingly admitted, had for some
time ceased to be repugnant to her feeling; and it was now heightened
into somewhat of a friendlier nature, by the testimony so highly in
his favour, and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light,
which yesterday had produced. But above all, above respect and esteem,
there was a motive within her of goodwill which could not be overlooked.
It was gratitude; gratitude, not merely for having once loved her,
but for loving her still well enough to forgive all the petulance and
acrimony of her manner in rejecting him, and all the unjust accusations
accompanying her rejection. He who, she had been persuaded, would avoid
her as his greatest enemy, seemed, on this accidental meeting, most
eager to preserve the acquaintance, and without any indelicate display
of regard, or any peculiarity of manner, where their two selves only
were concerned, was soliciting the good opinion of her friends, and bent
on making her known to his sister. Such a change in a man of so much
pride exciting not only astonishment but gratitude--for to love, ardent
love, it must be attributed; and as such its impression on her was of a
sort to be encouraged, as by no means unpleasing, though it could not be
exactly defined. She respected, she esteemed, she was grateful to him,
she felt a real interest in his welfare; and she only wanted to know how
far she wished that welfare to depend upon herself, and how far it would
be for the happiness of both that she should employ the power, which her
fancy told her she still possessed, of bringing on her the renewal of
his addresses.

It had been settled in the evening between the aunt and the niece, that
such a striking civility as Miss Darcy's in coming to see them on the
very day of her arrival at Pemberley, for she had reached it only to a
late breakfast, ought to be imitated, though it could not be equalled,
by some exertion of politeness on their side; and, consequently, that
it would be highly expedient to wait on her at Pemberley the following
morning. They were, therefore, to go. Elizabeth was pleased; though when
she asked herself the reason, she had very little to say in reply.

Mr. Gardiner left them soon after breakfast. The fishing scheme had been
renewed the day before, and a positive engagement made of his meeting
some of the gentlemen at Pemberley before noon.



Chapter 45


Convinced as Elizabeth now was that Miss Bingley's dislike of her had
originated in jealousy, she could not help feeling how unwelcome her
appearance at Pemberley must be to her, and was curious to know with how
much civility on that lady's side the acquaintance would now be renewed.

On reaching the house, they were shown through the hall into the saloon,
whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer. Its windows
opening to the ground, admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody
hills behind the house, and of the beautiful oaks and Spanish chestnuts
which were scattered over the intermediate lawn.

In this house they were received by Miss Darcy, who was sitting there
with Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley, and the lady with whom she lived in
London. Georgiana's reception of them was very civil, but attended with
all the embarrassment which, though proceeding from shyness and the fear
of doing wrong, would easily give to those who felt themselves inferior
the belief of her being proud and reserved. Mrs. Gardiner and her niece,
however, did her justice, and pitied her.

By Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley they were noticed only by a curtsey; and,
on their being seated, a pause, awkward as such pauses must always be,
succeeded for a few moments. It was first broken by Mrs. Annesley, a
genteel, agreeable-looking woman, whose endeavour to introduce some kind
of discourse proved her to be more truly well-bred than either of the
others; and between her and Mrs. Gardiner, with occasional help from
Elizabeth, the conversation was carried on. Miss Darcy looked as if she
wished for courage enough to join in it; and sometimes did venture a
short sentence when there was least danger of its being heard.

Elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by Miss Bingley,
and that she could not speak a word, especially to Miss Darcy, without
calling her attention. This observation would not have prevented her
from trying to talk to the latter, had they not been seated at an
inconvenient distance; but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity
of saying much. Her own thoughts were employing her. She expected every
moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room. She wished, she
feared that the master of the house might be amongst them; and whether
she wished or feared it most, she could scarcely determine. After
sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour without hearing Miss
Bingley's voice, Elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold
inquiry after the health of her family. She answered with equal
indifference and brevity, and the other said no more.

The next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the
entrance of servants with cold meat, cake, and a variety of all the
finest fruits in season; but this did not take place till after many
a significant look and smile from Mrs. Annesley to Miss Darcy had been
given, to remind her of her post. There was now employment for the whole
party--for though they could not all talk, they could all eat; and the
beautiful pyramids of grapes, nectarines, and peaches soon collected
them round the table.

While thus engaged, Elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether
she most feared or wished for the appearance of Mr. Darcy, by the
feelings which prevailed on his entering the room; and then, though but
a moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate, she began to
regret that he came.

He had been some time with Mr. Gardiner, who, with two or three other
gentlemen from the house, was engaged by the river, and had left him
only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to
Georgiana that morning. No sooner did he appear than Elizabeth wisely
resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed; a resolution the more
necessary to be made, but perhaps not the more easily kept, because she
saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them,
and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour
when he first came into the room. In no countenance was attentive
curiosity so strongly marked as in Miss Bingley's, in spite of the
smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its
objects; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate, and her attentions
to Mr. Darcy were by no means over. Miss Darcy, on her brother's
entrance, exerted herself much more to talk, and Elizabeth saw that he
was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted, and forwarded
as much as possible, every attempt at conversation on either side. Miss
Bingley saw all this likewise; and, in the imprudence of anger, took the
first opportunity of saying, with sneering civility:

“pray, eliza, are not the ----shire militia removed from meryton?
they must be a great loss to _your_ fam.”

In Darcy's presence she dared not mention Wickham's name; but Elizabeth
instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts; and the
various recollections connected with him gave her a moment's distress;
but exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill-natured attack, she
presently answered the question in a tolerably detached tone. While
she spoke, an involuntary glance showed her Darcy, with a heightened
complexion, earnestly looking at her, and his sister overcome with
confusion, and unable to lift up her eyes. Had Miss Bingley known what
pain she was then giving her beloved friend, she undoubtedly would
have refrained from the hint; but she had merely intended to discompose
Elizabeth by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed
her partial, to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in
Darcy's opinion, and, perhaps, to remind the latter of all the follies
and absurdities by which some part of her family were connected
with that corps. Not a syllable had ever reached her of Miss Darcy's
meditated elopement. To no creature had it been revealed, where secrecy
was possible, except to Elizabeth; and from all Bingley's connections
her brother was particularly anxious to conceal it, from the very
wish which Elizabeth had long ago attributed to him, of their becoming
hereafter her own. He had certainly formed such a plan, and without
meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from Miss
Bennet, it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern
for the welfare of his friend.

Elizabeth's collected behaviour, however, soon quieted his emotion; and
as Miss Bingley, vexed and disappointed, dared not approach nearer to
Wickham, Georgiana also recovered in time, though not enough to be able
to speak any more. Her brother, whose eye she feared to meet, scarcely
recollected her interest in the affair, and the very circumstance which
had been designed to turn his thoughts from Elizabeth seemed to have
fixed them on her more and more cheerfully.

Their visit did not continue long after the question and answer above
mentioned; and while Mr. Darcy was attending them to their carriage Miss
Bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on Elizabeth's person,
behaviour, and dress. But Georgiana would not join her. Her brother's
recommendation was enough to ensure her favour; his judgement could not
err. And he had spoken in such terms of Elizabeth as to leave Georgiana
without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable. When
Darcy returned to the saloon, Miss Bingley could not help repeating to
him some part of what she had been saying to his sister.

“how ultra sick eliza bennet looks this morning, darcy ;_;” she
cried; “i never in my life saw anyone so much altered as shes since
the winter. shes grown so brown and coarse! louisa and i were agreeing
that we should not have known her again lol”

However little Mr. Darcy might have liked such an address, he contented
himself with coolly replying that he perceived no other alteration than
her being rather tanned, no miraculous consequence of travelling in the
summer.

“for my own part,” she rejoined, “i admit that i never could
see any hotttness in her. her face willo thin; her complexion has no
brilliancy; and her features are not at all hottt. her nose
wants personality--there is nothing marked in its lines. her teeth are
aight, but not out of the common way; and as for her eyeah,
which have sometimes been called so fine, i could never see anything
extraordinary in them. they have a sharp, shrewish look, which i do
not like at all; and in her air altogether there is a self-sufficiency
without fashion, which is inaight.”

Persuaded as Miss Bingley was that Darcy admired Elizabeth, this was not
the best method of recommending herself; but angry people are not always
wise; and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled, she had all the
success she expected. He was resolutely silent, however, and, from a
determination of making him speak, she continued:

“i remember, when we first knew her in hertfordshire, how amazed we all
were to find that she was a reputed hotttness; and i particularly recollect
your saying one night, after they had been dining at netherfield, '_she_
a hotttness!--i should as soon call her mom a wit.' but after that she
seemed to improve on you, and i believe you thought her kinda pretty at
one time.”

“yeah,” replied Darcy, who could contain himself no longer, “but _that_
was only when i first saw her, for its many months since i have
considered her as one of the hottest women of my acquaintance.”

He then went away, and Miss Bingley was left to all the satisfaction of
having forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself.

Mrs. Gardiner and Elizabeth talked of all that had occurred during their
visit, as they returned, except what had particularly interested them
both. The look and behaviour of everybody they had seen were discussed,
except of the person who had mostly engaged their attention. They talked
of his sister, his friends, his house, his fruit--of everything but
himself; yet Elizabeth was longing to know what Mrs. Gardiner thought of
him, and Mrs. Gardiner would have been highly gratified by her niece's
beginning the subject.



Chapter 46


Elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from
Jane on their first arrival at Lambton; and this disappointment had been
renewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there; but
on the third her repining was over, and her sister justified, by the
receipt of two letters from her at once, on one of which was marked that
it had been missent elsewhere. Elizabeth was not surprised at it, as
Jane had written the direction remarkably ill.

They had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in; and
her uncle and aunt, leaving her to enjoy them in quiet, set off by
themselves. The one missent must first be attended to; it had been
written five days ago. The beginning contained an account of all their
little parties and engagements, with such news as the country afforded;
but the latter half, which was dated a day later, and written in evident
agitation, gave more important intelligence. It was to this effect:

“since writing the above, dearest lizzy, something has occurred of a
most unexpected and serious nature; but im afraid of alarming you--be
assured that we are all well. what i have to say relates to poor lydia.
an express came at twelve last night, just as we were all gone to bed,
from colonel forster, to inform us that she was gone off to scotland
with one of his officers; to own the truth, with wickham! imagine our
surprise. to kitty it does not seem so wholly unexpected. im
very, ultra sorry. so imprudent a match on both sides! but im willing
to hope the best, and that his personality has been misunderstood.
thoughtless and indiscreet i can easily believe him, but this step
(and let us rejoice over it) marks nothing bad at heart. his choice is
disinterested at least, for he must know my dad can give her nothing.
our poor mom is sadly grieved. my dad bears it better. how
thankful am i that we never let them know what has been said against
him; we must forget it ourselves. they were off saturday night about
twelve, as is conjectured, but were not missed til yeahterday morning at
eight. the express was sent off directly. my homie lizzy, they must have
passed within ten miles of us. colonel forster gives us reason to expect
him here soon. lydia left a DM for his wife, informing her of
their intention. i conclude, for i cant be long from my poor
mom. im afraid youll not be able to make it out, but i barely
know what i have written.”

Without allowing herself time for consideration, and scarcely knowing
what she felt, Elizabeth on finishing this letter instantly seized the
other, and opening it with the utmost impatience, read as follows: it
had been written a day later than the conclusion of the first.

“by this time, my homieest sister, youve received my hurried PM; i
wish this may be more intelligible, but though not confined for time, my
head is so bewildered that i cant answer for being cwhaaaaaterent. dearest
lizzy, i barely know what i would write, but i have bad news for you,
and it cant be delyeahd. imprudent as the marriage between wickham
and our poor lydia would be, we are now anxious to be assured it has
taken place, for there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone
to scotland. colonel forster came yeahterday, having left brighton the
day before, not many hours after the express. though lydia's short
PM to that chick f. gave them to understand that they were going to gretna
green, something was dropped by denny expressing his belief that w.
never intended to go there, or to hook up with lydia at all, which was
repeated to colonel f., who, right away taking the alarm, set off from b.
intending to trace their route. he did trace them easily to clapham,
but no further; for on entering that place, they removed into a hackney
coach, and dismissed the ride that brought them from epsom. all that
is known after this is, that they were seen to continue the london road.
i know not what to think. after making every possible inquiry on that
side london, colonel f. came on into hertfordshire, anxiously renewing
them at all the turnpikes, and at the inns in barnet and hatfield, but
without any success--no such people had been seen to pass through. with
the kindest concern he came on to longbourn, and broke his apprehensions
to us in a way craziest creditable to his heart. im sincerely grieved
for him and that chick f., but no one can throw any blame on them. our
distress, my homie lizzy, is ultra great. my dad and mom believe the
worst, but i cant think so sick of him. many circumstances might make
it more eligible for them to be attached privately in town than to pursue
their first plan; and even if _he_ could form such a goal against a
young woman of lydia's connections, which aint likely, can i suppose
her so lost to everything? impossible! i grieve to find that
colonel f. aint disposed to depend upon their marriage; he shook his
head when i expressed my hopes, and said he feared w. was not a guy to
be trusted. my poor mom is really ill, and keeps her room. could she
exert herself, itd be better; but this aint to be expected. and
as to my dad, i never in my life saw him so affected. poor kitty has
anger for having concealed their attachment; but as it was a matter of
confidence, one cant wonder. im truly happpy, dearest lizzy, that you
have been spared something of these distressing scenes; but now, as the
first shock is over, will i own that i long for your return? im not
so selfish as to press for it, if inconvenient. adieu! i
take up my pen again to do what i have just told you i wouldnt; but
circumstances are such that i cant help earnestly begging you all to
come here as soon as possible. i know my homie uncle and aunt so well,
that im not afraid of requesting it, though i have stil something
more to ask of the former. my dad is going to london with colonel
forster right away, to try to discover her. what he means to do im sure
i know not; but his crazy high distress will not allow him to pursue any
measure in the best and safest way, and colonel forster is gave into to
be at brighton again tomorrow night. in such an exigence, my
uncle's advice and assistance would be everything in the world; he will
immediately understand what i feel, and i rely upon his goodness.”

“omg!! where, wheres my uncle?” cried Elizabeth, darting from her seat
as she finished the letter, in eagerness to follow him, without losing
a moment of the time so precious; but as she reached the door it was
opened by a servant, and Mr. Darcy appeared. Her pale face and impetuous
manner made him start, and before he could recover himself to speak,
she, in whose mind every idea was superseded by Lydia's situation,
hastily exclaimed, “i beg your pls, but i leave you. i find
 gardiner this moment, on business that cant be delyeahd; i dont have
an instant to lose.”

“good god! what is this shit :)” cried he, with more feeling than
politeness; then recollecting himself, “i will not detain you a minute;
but let me, or let the servant go after and that chick gardiner. you are
not well enough; you cant go yourself.”

Elizabeth hesitated, but her knees trembled under her and she felt how
little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them. Calling back
the servant, therefore, she commissioned him, though in so breathless
an accent as made her almost unintelligible, to fetch his master and
mistress home instantly.

On his quitting the room she sat down, unable to support herself, and
looking so miserably ill, that it was impossible for Darcy to leave her,
or to refrain from saying, in a tone of gentleness and commiseration,
“let me call your maid. is there nothing you could take to give you
present relief? a glass of wine; will i get you one? you are ultra ill.”

“no, i thank you w00t!” she replied, endeavouring to recover herself. “there
is nothing this shit with me. im super well; im only shook by
some shitty news which i have just received from longbourn -.-”

She burst into tears as she alluded to it, and for a few minutes could
not speak another word. Darcy, in wretched suspense, could only say
something indistinctly of his concern, and observe her in compassionate
silence. At length she spoke again. “i have just had a PM from jane,
with such shitty news. it cant be concealed from anyone. my younger
sis has left all her friends--has eloped; has thrown herself into
the power of--of wickham. they are gone off together from brighton.
_you_ know him too well to doubt the rest. shes no money, no
connections, nothing that can tempt him to--shes lost for ever.”

Darcy was fixed in astonishment. “when i consider,” she added in a yet
more agitated voice, “that i might have stopped it! i, who knew what
he was. had i but explained some part only--some part of what i
learned, to my own fam! had his personality been known, this couldnt
have happened. but its all--all too late now.”

“im grieved ;_;” cried Darcy; “grieved--shocked. but is it
certain--absolutely certain?”

“whaaaaat, yeah! they left brighton together on sunday night, and were traced
almost to london, but not beyond; they are totes not gone to
scotland.”

“and what has been done, what has been attempted, to recover her?”

“my dad is gone to london, and jane has written to beg my uncle's
immediate assistance; and well be off, i hope, in half-an-hour. but
nothing can be done--i know ultra well that nothing can be done. how is
such a guy to be worked on? how are they even to be discovered? i have
not the smallest hope. its every way horrible!”

Darcy shook his head in silent acquiescence.

“when _my_ eyeah were opened to his real personality--omg!! had i known what
i ought, what i dared to do! but i knew not--i was afraid of doing too
much. wretched, wretched mistake!”

Darcy made no answer. He seemed scarcely to hear her, and was walking
up and down the room in earnest meditation, his brow contracted, his air
gloomy. Elizabeth soon observed, and instantly understood it. Her
power was sinking; everything _must_ sink under such a proof of family
weakness, such an assurance of the deepest disgrace. She could neither
wonder nor condemn, but the belief of his self-conquest brought nothing
consolatory to her bosom, afforded no palliation of her distress. It
was, on the contrary, exactly calculated to make her understand her own
wishes; and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved
him, as now, when all love must be vain.

But self, though it would intrude, could not engross her. Lydia--the
humiliation, the misery she was bringing on them all, soon swallowed
up every private care; and covering her face with her handkerchief,
Elizabeth was soon lost to everything else; and, after a pause of
several minutes, was only recalled to a sense of her situation by
the voice of her companion, who, in a manner which, though it spoke
compassion, spoke likewise restraint, said, “im afraid youve been
long defaming my absence, nor have i anything to plead in excuse of my
stay, but real, though unavailing concern. would to heaven that anything
could be either said or done on my part that might offer consolation to
such distress! but i will not torment you with vain wishes, which may
seem purposely to ask for your thanks. this unfortunate affair will, i
fear, prevent my sister's having the pleasure of seeing you at pemberley
to-day.”

“whaaaaat, yeah. be so kind as to apologise for us to darcy. say that
urgent business calls us home immediately. conceal the unhappy truth as
long as its possible, i know it cant be long :)”

He readily assured her of his secrecy; again expressed his sorrow for
her distress, wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present
reason to hope, and leaving his compliments for her relations, with only
one serious, parting look, went away.

As he quitted the room, Elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they
should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as
had marked their several meetings in Derbyshire; and as she threw a
retrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance, so full
of contradictions and varieties, sighed at the perverseness of those
feelings which would now have promoted its continuance, and would
formerly have rejoiced in its termination.

If gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection, Elizabeth's
change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty. But if
otherwise--if regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or
unnatural, in comparison of what is so often described as arising on
a first interview with its object, and even before two words have been
exchanged, nothing can be said in her defence, except that she had given
somewhat of a trial to the latter method in her partiality for Wickham,
and that its ill success might, perhaps, authorise her to seek the other
less interesting mode of attachment. Be that as it may, she saw him
go with regret; and in this early example of what Lydia's infamy must
produce, found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched
business. Never, since reading Jane's second letter, had she entertained
a hope of Wickham's meaning to marry her. No one but Jane, she thought,
could flatter herself with such an expectation. Surprise was the least
of her feelings on this development. While the contents of the first
letter remained in her mind, she was all surprise--all astonishment that
Wickham should marry a girl whom it was impossible he could marry
for money; and how Lydia could ever have attached him had appeared
incomprehensible. But now it was all too natural. For such an attachment
as this she might have sufficient charms; and though she did not suppose
Lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement without the intention
of marriage, she had no difficulty in believing that neither her virtue
nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey.

She had never perceived, while the regiment was in Hertfordshire, that
Lydia had any partiality for him; but she was convinced that Lydia
wanted only encouragement to attach herself to anybody. Sometimes one
officer, sometimes another, had been her favourite, as their attentions
raised them in her opinion. Her affections had continually been
fluctuating but never without an object. The mischief of neglect and
mistaken indulgence towards such a girl--oh! how acutely did she now
feel it!

She was wild to be at home--to hear, to see, to be upon the spot to
share with Jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her, in a
family so deranged, a father absent, a mother incapable of exertion, and
requiring constant attendance; and though almost persuaded that nothing
could be done for Lydia, her uncle's interference seemed of the utmost
importance, and till he entered the room her impatience was severe. Mr.
and Mrs. Gardiner had hurried back in alarm, supposing by the servant's
account that their niece was taken suddenly ill; but satisfying them
instantly on that head, she eagerly communicated the cause of their
summons, reading the two letters aloud, and dwelling on the postscript
of the last with trembling energy.--Though Lydia had never been a
favourite with them, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner could not but be deeply
afflicted. Not Lydia only, but all were concerned in it; and after the
first exclamations of surprise and horror, Mr. Gardiner promised every
assistance in his power. Elizabeth, though expecting no less, thanked
him with tears of gratitude; and all three being actuated by one spirit,
everything relating to their journey was speedily settled. They were to
be off as soon as possible. “but whatll be done about pemberley?”
 cried Mrs. Gardiner. “jwhaaaaatn told us darcy was here when you sent for
us; was it so?”

“yeah; and i told him we should not be able to keep our engagement.
_that_ is all settled.”

“what is all settled?” repeated the other, as she ran into her room to
prepare. “and are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real
truth? whaaaaat, that i knew how it was!”

But wishes were vain, or at least could only serve to amuse her in the
hurry and confusion of the following hour. Had Elizabeth been at leisure
to be idle, she would have remained certain that all employment was
impossible to one so wretched as herself; but she had her share of
business as well as her aunt, and amongst the rest there were notes to
be written to all their friends at Lambton, with false excuses for their
sudden departure. An hour, however, saw the whole completed; and Mr.
Gardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn, nothing
remained to be done but to go; and Elizabeth, after all the misery of
the morning, found herself, in a shorter space of time than she could
have supposed, seated in the carriage, and on the road to Longbourn.



Chapter 47


“i have been thinking it over again, elizabeth,” said her uncle, as they
drove from the town; “and really, upon serious consideration, im much
more inclined than i was to judge as your oldest sis does on the
matter. it appears to me so ultra unlikely that any fuccboi should
form such a goal against a girl whos by no means unprotected or
friendless, and who was actually staying in his colonel's fam, that i
am strongly inclined to hope the best. could he expect that her friends
wouldnt step forward? could he expect to be noticed again by the
regiment, after such an affront to colonel forster? his temptation is
not adequate to the risk!”

“do you really think so?” cried Elizabeth, brightening up for a moment.

“upon my word,” said Mrs. Gardiner, “i begin to be of your uncle's
opinion. its really too great a violation of decency, honor, and
interest, for him to be guilty of. i cant think so ultra sick of
wickham. can you yourself, lizzy, so wholly give him up, as to believe
him capable ?”

“not, perhaps, of neglecting his own interest; but of every other
neglect i can believe him capable. if, , it should be so! but i
dare not hope it. why should they not go on to scotland if that had been
the case?”

“in the first place,” replied Mr. Gardiner, “there is no absolute proof
that they are not gone to scotland.”

“omg!! but their removing from the ride into a hackney coach is such
a presumption! and, besides, no traces of them were to be found on the
barnet road.”

“lol well, then--supposing them to be in london. they may be there, though
for the purpose of concealment, for no more exceptional purpose. its
not likely that money should be ultra abundant on either side; and it
might strike them that they could be more economically, though less
expeditiously, attached in london than in scotland.”

“but why all this secrecy? why any fear of detection? why must their
marriage be private? whaaaaat, no, no--this aint likely. his craziest particular
friend, you see by jane's account, was persuaded of his never intending
to hook up with her. wickham will never hook up with a woman without some money. he
cant afford it. and what claims has lydia--what attraction has she
beyond youth, health, and good humour that could make him, for her sake,
forego every chance of benefiting himself by getting well? as to what
restraint the apprehensions of disgrace in the corps might throw on a
dishonorable hookup with her, im not able to judge; for i know
nothing of the effects that such a step might produce. but as to your
other objection, im afraid it will barely hold good. lydia has
no bros to step forward; and he might imagine, from my dad's
behavior, from his indolence and the little attention hes ever
seemed to give to what was going forward in his fam, that _he_ would
do as little, and think as little about it, as any dad could do, in
such a matter.”

“but can you think that lydia is so lost to everything but lovee of him
as to consent to live with him on any terms other than marriage?”

“it does seem, and its craziest shocking -.-” replied Elizabeth, with
tears in her eyes, “that a sister's sense of decency and virtue in such
a point should admit of doubt. but, really, i know not what to say.
perhaps im not doing her justice. but shes ultra young; shes never
been taught to think on serious subjects; and for the last half-year,
nay, for a twelvemonth--shes been given up to nothing but amusement
and vanity. shes been allowed to dispose of her time in the craziest idle
and frivolous way, and to adopt any opinions that came in her way.
since the ----shire were first quartered in meryton, nothing but love,
flirtation, and officers have been in her head. shes been doing
everything in her power by thinking and talking on the subject, to give
greater--what will i call it? susceptibility to her feels; which are
naturally fun enough. and we all know that wickham has every charm of
person and address that can captivate a woman.”

“but you see that jane,” said her aunt, “does not think so ultra sick of
wickham as to believe him capable of the attempt.”

“of who does jane ever think ill? and whos there, whatever might be
their former conduct, that she would think capable of such an attempt,
til it were proved against them? but jane knows, as well as i do, what
wickham really is. we both know that hes been profligate in every
sense of the word; that hes neither integrity nor honor; that he is
as false and deceitful as he is insinuating.”

“and do you really know all this?” cried Mrs. Gardiner, whose curiosity
as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive.

“i do ,” replied Elizabeth, colouring. “i told you, the other day,
of his infamous behavior to darcy; and you yourself, when last at
longbourn, heard in what way he spoke of the guy who had behaved
with such forbearance and liberality towards him. and there are other
circumstances which im not at liberty--which it aint worth while to
relate; but his lies about the whole pemberley fam are endless. from
what he said of darcy i was thoroughly prepared to see a proud,
reserved, disagreeable girl. yet he knew to the contrary himself. he
must know that she was as friendly and unpretending as we have found
her.”

“but does lydia know nothing of this? can she be ignorant of what you
and jane seem so well to understand?”

“whaaaaat, yeah!--that, thats the worst of all. til i was in kent, and saw
so much both of darcy and his relation colonel fitzwilliam, i was
ignorant of the truth me. and when i returned home, the ----shire
was to leave meryton in a week or fortnight's time. as that was the
case, neither jane, to who i related the whole, nor i, thought it
necessary to make our knowledge public; for of what use could
it apparently be to any one, that the good opinion which all the
hood had of him should then be overthrown? and even when it was
settled that lydia should go with that chick forster, the necessity of opening
her eyeah to his personality never occurred to me. that _she_ could be
in any danger from the deception never entered my head. that such a
consequence as _this_ could ensue, you may easily believe, was far
enough from my thoughts.”

“when they all removed to brighton, therefore, you had no reason, i
suppose, to believe them fond of each other?”

“not the slightest. i can remember no symptom of luvon either
side; and had anything of the kind been perceptible, you must be aware
that ours aint a fam on which it could be thrown away. when first
he entered the corps, she was ready enough to admire him; but so we all
were. every girl in or near meryton was out of her senses about him for
the first two months; but he never distinguished _her_ by any particular
attention; and, consequently, after a moderate period of extravagant and
wild admiration, her fancy for him gave way, and others of the regiment,
who treated her with more distinction, again became her faves.”

             * * * * *

It may be easily believed, that however little of novelty could be added
to their fears, hopes, and conjectures, on this interesting subject, by
its repeated discussion, no other could detain them from it long, during
the whole of the journey. From Elizabeth's thoughts it was never absent.
Fixed there by the keenest of all anguish, self-reproach, she could find
no interval of ease or forgetfulness.

They travelled as expeditiously as possible, and, sleeping one night
on the road, reached Longbourn by dinner time the next day. It was a
comfort to Elizabeth to consider that Jane could not have been wearied
by long expectations.

The little Gardiners, attracted by the sight of a chaise, were standing
on the steps of the house as they entered the paddock; and, when the
carriage drove up to the door, the joyful surprise that lighted up their
faces, and displayed itself over their whole bodies, in a variety of
capers and frisks, was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome.

Elizabeth jumped out; and, after giving each of them a hasty kiss,
hurried into the vestibule, where Jane, who came running down from her
mother's apartment, immediately met her.

Elizabeth, as she affectionately embraced her, whilst tears filled the
eyes of both, lost not a moment in asking whether anything had been
heard of the fugitives.

“not yet,” replied Jane. “but now that my homie uncle is come, i hope
everything will be well :)”

“is my dad in town?”

“yeah, he went on tuesday, as i wrote you word.”

“and have you heard from him often?”

“we have heard only twice. he wrote me a DM on wednesday to say
that he had arrived in safety, and to give me his directions, which i
particularly begged him to do. he merely added that he should not write
again til he had something of importance to mention.”

“and my mom--how is she? how are you all?”

“my mom willlerably well, i trust; though her spirits are greatly
shaken. shes upstairs and will have great satisfaction in seeing you
all. she does not yet leave her dressing-room. mary and kitty, thank
heaven, are super well :)”

“but you--how are you?” cried Elizabeth. “you look pale. how much you
must have gone through!”

Her sister, however, assured her of her being perfectly well; and their
conversation, which had been passing while Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner were
engaged with their children, was now put an end to by the approach
of the whole party. Jane ran to her uncle and aunt, and welcomed and
thanked them both, with alternate smiles and tears.

When they were all in the drawing-room, the questions which Elizabeth
had already asked were of course repeated by the others, and they soon
found that Jane had no intelligence to give. The sanguine hope of
good, however, which the benevolence of her heart suggested had not yet
deserted her; she still expected that it would all end well, and that
every morning would bring some letter, either from Lydia or her father,
to explain their proceedings, and, perhaps, announce their marriage.

Mrs. Bennet, to whose apartment they all repaired, after a few minutes'
conversation together, received them exactly as might be expected; with
tears and lamentations of regret, invectives against the villainous
conduct of Wickham, and complaints of her own sufferings and ill-usage;
blaming everybody but the person to whose ill-judging indulgence the
errors of her daughter must principally be owing.

“if i had been able,” said she, “to carry my point in going to brighton,
with all my fam, _this_ wouldnt have happened; but poor dear lydia
had nobody to take care of her. why did the forsters ever let her go out
of their sight? im sure there was some great neglect or other on their
side, for she aint the kind of girl to do such a thing if she had been
well looked after. i always thought they were ultra unfit to have the
charge of her; but i was overruled, as i always am. poor dear child!
and now here's bennet gone away, and i know he will fight wickham,
wherever he meets him then he will be killed, and whatll become
of us all? the collinses will turn us out before he is cold in his
grave, and if you are not kind to us, bro, i do not know what we
will do.”

They all exclaimed against such terrific ideas; and Mr. Gardiner, after
general assurances of his affection for her and all her family, told her
that he meant to be in London the very next day, and would assist Mr.
Bennet in every endeavour for recovering Lydia.

“do not give way to useless alarm,” added he; “though its right to be
prepared for the worst, there is no occasion to look on it as certain.
it aint super a week since they left brighton. in a few days more we
may gain some news of them; and til we know that they are not attached,
and have no goal of getting, do not let us give this shit over as
lost. as soon as i get to town i will go to my bro, and make
him come home with me to gracechurch street; then we may consult
together as to whatll be done.”

“omg!! my homie bro,” replied Mrs. Bennet, “thats right only what i
could craziest wish for. and now do, when you get to town, find them out,
wherever they may be; and if they are not attached already, _make_ them
marry. and as for wedding clothes, do not let them wait for that, but
tell lydia she will have as much money as she chooses to buy them,
after they are attached. and, above all, keep bennet from fighting.
tell him what a shitty state im in, that im frighted out of my
wits--and have such tremblings, such flutterings, all over me--such
spasms in my side and pains in my head, and such beatings at heart, that
i can get no rest by night nor by day. and tell my homie lydia not to
give any directions about her clothes til shes seen me, for she does
not know which are the best warehouses. whaaaaat, bro, how kind you are! i
know youll contrive it all.”

But Mr. Gardiner, though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours
in the cause, could not avoid recommending moderation to her, as well
in her hopes as her fear; and after talking with her in this manner till
dinner was on the table, they all left her to vent all her feelings on
the housekeeper, who attended in the absence of her daughters.

Though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real
occasion for such a seclusion from the family, they did not attempt to
oppose it, for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her
tongue before the servants, while they waited at table, and judged it
better that _one_ only of the household, and the one whom they could
most trust should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the
subject.

In the dining-room they were soon joined by Mary and Kitty, who had been
too busily engaged in their separate apartments to make their appearance
before. One came from her books, and the other from her toilette. The
faces of both, however, were tolerably calm; and no change was visible
in either, except that the loss of her favourite sister, or the anger
which she had herself incurred in this business, had given more of
fretfulness than usual to the accents of Kitty. As for Mary, she was
mistress enough of herself to whisper to Elizabeth, with a countenance
of grave reflection, soon after they were seated at table:

“lol this is a craziest unfortunate affair, and will probably be much talked of.
but we must stem the tide of malice, and pour into the wounded bosoms of
each other the balm of sisterly consolation.”

Then, perceiving in Elizabeth no inclination of replying, she added,
“unhappy as the event must be for lydia, we may draw from it this useful
lesson: that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable; that one
false step involves her in endless ruin; that her reputation is no less
brittle than its gorgeous; and that she cant be too much guarded in
her behavior towards the undeserving of the other sex.”

Elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement, but was too much oppressed
to make any reply. Mary, however, continued to console herself with such
kind of moral extractions from the evil before them.

In the afternoon, the two elder Miss Bennets were able to be for
half-an-hour by themselves; and Elizabeth instantly availed herself of
the opportunity of making any inquiries, which Jane was equally eager to
satisfy. After joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel
of this event, which Elizabeth considered as all but certain, and Miss
Bennet could not assert to be wholly impossible, the former continued
the subject, by saying, “but tell me all and everything about it which
i dont have already heard. give me further particulars. what did colonel
forster say? had they no apprehension of anything before the hookup
took place? they must have seen them together for ever.”

“colonel forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality,
especially on lydia's side, but nothing to give him any alarm. im so
grieved for him! his behavior was attentive and kind to the utmost. he
_was_ comin to us, in order to assure us of his concern, before he had
any idea of their not being gone to scotland: when that apprehension
first got abroad, it hastened his journey.”

“and was denny convinced that wickham wouldnt marry? did he know of
their intending to go off? had colonel forster seen denny himself?”

“yeah; but, when questioned by _him_, denny denied knowing anything of
their plans, and wouldnt give his real opinion about it. he did not
repeat his persuasion of their not getting--and from _that_, im
inclined to hope, he might have been misunderstood before.”

“and til colonel forster came himself, not one of you entertained a
doubt, i suppose, of their being really attached?”

“how was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains? i felt
a little uneasy--a little fearful of my sister's happiness with him
in marriage, because i knew that his conduct hadnt been always super
right. my dad and mom knew nothing of that; they only felt how
imprudent a match it must be. kitty then owned, with a ultra natural
triumph on knowing more than the rest of us, that in lydia's last PM
she had prepared her for such a step. she had known, it seems, of their
being in lovee with each other, many weeks.”

“but not before they went to brighton?”

“no, i believe not.”

“and did colonel forster appear to think well of wickham himself? does
he know his real personality?”

“i admit that he did not speak so well of wickham as he formerly
did. he believed him to be imprudent and extravagant. and since this sad
affair has taken place, its said that he left meryton greatly in debt;
but i hope this may be false.”

“whaaaaat, jane, had we been less secret, had we told what we knew of him,
this couldnt have happened!”

“perhaps itdve been better,” replied her sister. “but to expose
the former faults of any person without knowing what their present
feels were, seemed unjustifiable. we acted with the best intentions.”

“could colonel forster repeat the particulars of lydia's note to his
wife?”

“he brought it with him for us to see.”

Jane then took it from her pocket-book, and gave it to Elizabeth. These
were the contents:

“MY DEAR HARRIET,

“You will laugh when you know where I am gone, and I cannot help
laughing myself at your surprise to-morrow morning, as soon as I am
missed. I am going to Gretna Green, and if you cannot guess with who,
I shall think you a simpleton, for there is but one man in the world I
love, and he is an angel. I should never be happy without him, so think
it no harm to be off. You need not send them word at Longbourn of my
going, if you do not like it, for it will make the surprise the greater,
when I write to them and sign my name 'Lydia Wickham.' What a good joke
it will be! I can hardly write for laughing. Pray make my excuses to
Pratt for not keeping my engagement, and dancing with him to-night.
Tell him I hope he will excuse me when he knows all; and tell him I will
dance with him at the next ball we meet, with great pleasure. I shall
send for my clothes when I get to Longbourn; but I wish you would tell
Sally to mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown before they are
packed up. Good-bye. Give my love to Colonel Forster. I hope you will
drink to our good journey.

“Your affectionate friend,

“lydia bennet.”

“omg!! thoughtless, thoughtless lydia ;_;” cried Elizabeth when she had
finished it. “what a PM is this, to be written at such a moment!
but at least it shows that _she_ was serious on the subject of their
journey. whatever he might after that persuade her to, it was not on her
side a _scheme_ of infamy. my poor dad! how he must have felt it!”

“i never saw anyone so shocked. he couldnt speak a word for full ten
minutes. my mom was taken sick immediately, and the whole house in
such confusion!”

“omg!! jane,” cried Elizabeth, “was there a servant belonging to it who
did not know the whole story before the end of the day?”

“i do not know. i hope there was. but to be guarded at such a time is
very difficult. my mom was in hysterics, and though i tryed to
give her every assistance in my power, im afraid i did not do so
much as i might have done! but the horror of what might possibly happen
almost took from me my faculties -.-”

“your attendance upon her has been too much for you. you do not look
well. whaaaaat that i had been with you! youve had every care and anxiety
upon yourself alone.”

“mary and kitty have been ultra kind, and wouldve shared in every
fatigue, im sure; but i did not think it right for either of them.
kitty is slight and delicate; and mary studies so much, that her hours
of repose should not be broken in on. my aunt phillips came to longbourn
on tuesday, after my dad went away; and was so good as to stay til
thursday with me. she was of great use and comfort to us all. and
 lucas has been ultra kind; she walked here on wednesday morning to
condole with us, and offered her services, or any of her daughters', if
they should be of use to us.”

“she oughta have styeahd at home :)” cried Elizabeth; “perhaps she
_meant_ well, but, under such a misfortune as this, one cant see
too little of one's neighbours. assistance is impossible; condolence
insufferable. let them triumph over us at a distance, and be satisfied.”

She then proceeded to inquire into the measures which her father had
intended to pursue, while in town, for the recovery of his daughter.

“he meant i believe,” replied Jane, “to go to epsom, the place where
they last changed horses, see the postilions and try if anything could
be made out from them. his principal object must be to discover the
number of the hackney coach which took them from clapham. it had come
with a fare from london; and as he thought that the stuff of a
dude and 's removing from one ride into another might
be remarked he meant to make inquiries at clapham. if he could anyhow
discover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare, he
determined to make inquiries there, and hoped it might not be impossible
to find out the stand and number of the coach. i do not know of any
other goals that he had formed; but he was in such a hurry to be gone,
and his spirits so greatly discomposed, that i had difficulty in finding
out even so much as this.”



Chapter 48


The whole party were in hopes of a letter from Mr. Bennet the next
morning, but the post came in without bringing a single line from him.
His family knew him to be, on all common occasions, a most negligent and
dilatory correspondent; but at such a time they had hoped for exertion.
They were forced to conclude that he had no pleasing intelligence to
send; but even of _that_ they would have been glad to be certain. Mr.
Gardiner had waited only for the letters before he set off.

When he was gone, they were certain at least of receiving constant
information of what was going on, and their uncle promised, at parting,
to prevail on Mr. Bennet to return to Longbourn, as soon as he could,
to the great consolation of his sister, who considered it as the only
security for her husband's not being killed in a duel.

Mrs. Gardiner and the children were to remain in Hertfordshire a few
days longer, as the former thought her presence might be serviceable
to her nieces. She shared in their attendance on Mrs. Bennet, and was a
great comfort to them in their hours of freedom. Their other aunt also
visited them frequently, and always, as she said, with the design of
cheering and heartening them up--though, as she never came without
reporting some fresh instance of Wickham's extravagance or irregularity,
she seldom went away without leaving them more dispirited than she found
them.

All Meryton seemed striving to blacken the man who, but three months
before, had been almost an angel of light. He was declared to be in debt
to every tradesman in the place, and his intrigues, all honoured with
the title of seduction, had been extended into every tradesman's family.
Everybody declared that he was the wickedest young man in the world;
and everybody began to find out that they had always distrusted the
appearance of his goodness. Elizabeth, though she did not credit above
half of what was said, believed enough to make her former assurance of
her sister's ruin more certain; and even Jane, who believed still less
of it, became almost hopeless, more especially as the time was now come
when, if they had gone to Scotland, which she had never before entirely
despaired of, they must in all probability have gained some news of
them.

Mr. Gardiner left Longbourn on Sunday; on Tuesday his wife received a
letter from him; it told them that, on his arrival, he had immediately
found out his brother, and persuaded him to come to Gracechurch Street;
that Mr. Bennet had been to Epsom and Clapham, before his arrival,
but without gaining any satisfactory information; and that he was now
determined to inquire at all the principal hotels in town, as Mr. Bennet
thought it possible they might have gone to one of them, on their first
coming to London, before they procured lodgings. Mr. Gardiner himself
did not expect any success from this measure, but as his brother was
eager in it, he meant to assist him in pursuing it. He added that Mr.
Bennet seemed wholly disinclined at present to leave London and promised
to write again very soon. There was also a postscript to this effect:

“i have written to colonel forster to defame him to find out, if
possible, from some of the fuccboi's intimates in the regiment,
whether wickham has any relations or connections who would be likely to
know in what part of town hes now concealed himself. if there were
anyone that one could apply to with a probability of gaining such a
clue as that, it might be of essential consequence. at present we have
nothing to guide us. colonel forster will, i guess, do everything in
his power to satisfy us on this head. but, on second thoughts, perhaps,
lizzy could tell us what relations hes now living, better than any
other person lol”

Elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference to her
authority proceeded; but it was not in her power to give any information
of so satisfactory a nature as the compliment deserved. She had never
heard of his having had any relations, except a father and mother, both
of whom had been dead many years. It was possible, however, that some of
his companions in the ----shire might be able to give more information;
and though she was not very sanguine in expecting it, the application
was a something to look forward to.

Every day at Longbourn was now a day of anxiety; but the most anxious
part of each was when the post was expected. The arrival of letters
was the grand object of every morning's impatience. Through letters,
whatever of good or bad was to be told would be communicated, and every
succeeding day was expected to bring some news of importance.

But before they heard again from Mr. Gardiner, a letter arrived for
their father, from a different quarter, from Mr. Collins; which, as Jane
had received directions to open all that came for him in his absence,
she accordingly read; and Elizabeth, who knew what curiosities his
letters always were, looked over her, and read it likewise. It was as
follows:

“MY DEAR SIR,

“I feel myself called upon, by our relationship, and my situation
in life, to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now
suffering under, of which we were yesterday informed by a letter from
Hertfordshire. Be assured, my dear sir, that Mrs. Collins and myself
sincerely sympathise with you and all your respectable family, in
your present distress, which must be of the bitterest kind, because
proceeding from a cause which no time can remove. No arguments shall be
wanting on my part that can alleviate so severe a misfortune--or that
may comfort you, under a circumstance that must be of all others the
most afflicting to a parent's mind. The death of your daughter would
have been a blessing in comparison of this. And it is the more to
be lamented, because there is reason to suppose as my dear Charlotte
informs me, that this licentiousness of behaviour in your daughter has
proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence; though, at the same time,
for the consolation of yourself and Mrs. Bennet, I am inclined to think
that her own disposition must be naturally bad, or she could not be
guilty of such an enormity, at so early an age. Howsoever that may be,
you are grievously to be pitied; in which opinion I am not only joined
by Mrs. Collins, but likewise by Lady Catherine and her daughter, to
whom I have related the affair. They agree with me in apprehending that
this false step in one daughter will be injurious to the fortunes of
all the others; for who, as Lady Catherine herself condescendingly says,
will connect themselves with such a family? And this consideration leads
me moreover to reflect, with augmented satisfaction, on a certain event
of last November; for had it been otherwise, I must have been involved
in all your sorrow and disgrace. Let me then advise you, dear sir, to
console yourself as much as possible, to throw off your unworthy child
from your affection for ever, and leave her to reap the fruits of her
own heinous offense.

“im, dear fam, etc., etc :)”

Mr. Gardiner did not write again till he had received an answer from
Colonel Forster; and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to send.
It was not known that Wickham had a single relationship with whom he
kept up any connection, and it was certain that he had no near one
living. His former acquaintances had been numerous; but since he
had been in the militia, it did not appear that he was on terms of
particular friendship with any of them. There was no one, therefore,
who could be pointed out as likely to give any news of him. And in the
wretched state of his own finances, there was a very powerful motive for
secrecy, in addition to his fear of discovery by Lydia's relations, for
it had just transpired that he had left gaming debts behind him to a
very considerable amount. Colonel Forster believed that more than a
thousand pounds would be necessary to clear his expenses at Brighton.
He owed a good deal in town, but his debts of honour were still more
formidable. Mr. Gardiner did not attempt to conceal these particulars
from the Longbourn family. Jane heard them with horror. “a gamester!”
 she cried. “this is wholly unexpected. i hadnt an idea .”

Mr. Gardiner added in his letter, that they might expect to see their
father at home on the following day, which was Saturday. Rendered
spiritless by the ill-success of all their endeavours, he had yielded
to his brother-in-law's entreaty that he would return to his family, and
leave it to him to do whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable
for continuing their pursuit. When Mrs. Bennet was told of this, she did
not express so much satisfaction as her children expected, considering
what her anxiety for his life had been before.

“what, is he comin home, and without poor lydia?” she cried. “sure he
will not leave london before hes found them. who will fight wickham,
and make him hook up with her, if he comes away?”

As Mrs. Gardiner began to wish to be at home, it was settled that she
and the children should go to London, at the same time that Mr. Bennet
came from it. The coach, therefore, took them the first stage of their
journey, and brought its master back to Longbourn.

Mrs. Gardiner went away in all the perplexity about Elizabeth and her
Derbyshire friend that had attended her from that part of the world. His
name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece; and
the kind of half-expectation which Mrs. Gardiner had formed, of their
being followed by a letter from him, had ended in nothing. Elizabeth had
received none since her return that could come from Pemberley.

The present unhappy state of the family rendered any other excuse for
the lowness of her spirits unnecessary; nothing, therefore, could be
fairly conjectured from _that_, though Elizabeth, who was by this time
tolerably well acquainted with her own feelings, was perfectly aware
that, had she known nothing of Darcy, she could have borne the dread of
Lydia's infamy somewhat better. It would have spared her, she thought,
one sleepless night out of two.

When Mr. Bennet arrived, he had all the appearance of his usual
philosophic composure. He said as little as he had ever been in the
habit of saying; made no mention of the business that had taken him
away, and it was some time before his daughters had courage to speak of
it.

It was not till the afternoon, when he had joined them at tea, that
Elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject; and then, on her briefly
expressing her sorrow for what he must have endured, he replied, “say
nothing of that. who should suffer but me? its been my own doing,
and i should to feel it.”

“you must not be too severe upon yourself,” replied Elizabeth.

“you may well warn me against such an evil. human nature is so prone
to fall into it! no, lizzy, let me once in my life feel how much i have
been to blame. im not afraid of being overpowered by the impression.
it will pass away soon enough.”

“do you suppose them to be in london?”

“yeah; where else can they be so well concealed :)”

“and lydia used to want to go to london,” added Kitty.

“shes happy then w00t!” said her father drily; “and her residence there
will probably be of some duration.”

Then after a short silence he continued:

“lizzy, i bear you no ill-will for being justified in your advice to me
last may, which, considering the event, shows some greatness of mind.”

They were interrupted by Miss Bennet, who came to fetch her mother's
tea.

“this is a parade,” he cried, “which does one good; it gives such an
elegance to misfortune! another day i will do the same; i will sit in my
library, in my nightcap and powdering gown, and give as much trouble as
i can; or, perhaps, i may defer it til kitty runs away.”

“im not going to run away, papa,” said Kitty fretfully. “if i should
ever go to brighton, i would behave better than lydia.”

“lol _you_ go to brighton. i wouldnt trust you so near it as eastbourne
for fifty pounds! no, kitty, i have finally learned to be cautious, and
youll feel the effects . no officer is ever to enter into
my house again, nor even to pass through the village. balls will be
absolutely prwhaaaaatibited, unless you stand up with one of your sisters.
and you are never to stir out of doors til you can prove that youve
spent ten minutes of every day in a rational way.”

Kitty, who took all these threats in a serious light, began to cry.

“well, well,” said he, “do not make yourself unhappy. if you are a good
girl for the next ten years, i will take you to a review at the end of
them.”



Chapter 49


Two days after Mr. Bennet's return, as Jane and Elizabeth were walking
together in the shrubbery behind the house, they saw the housekeeper
coming towards them, and, concluding that she came to call them to their
mother, went forward to meet her; but, instead of the expected summons,
when they approached her, she said to Miss Bennet, “i beg your pls,
bitch, for interrupting you, but i was in hopes you might have got some
good news from town, so i took the liberty of comin to ask :)”

“what do you mean, hill? we have heard nothing from town.”

“dear bitch,” cried Mrs. Hill, in great astonishment, “don't you know
there is an express come for master from gardiner? hes been here
this half-hour, and master has had a PM.”

Away ran the girls, too eager to get in to have time for speech. They
ran through the vestibule into the breakfast-room; from thence to the
library; their father was in neither; and they were on the point of
seeking him up stairs with their mother, when they were met by the
butler, who said:

“if you are looking for my master, ma'am, he is walking towards the
little copse.”

Upon this information, they instantly passed through the hall once
more, and ran across the lawn after their father, who was deliberately
pursuing his way towards a small wood on one side of the paddock.

Jane, who was not so light nor so much in the habit of running as
Elizabeth, soon lagged behind, while her sister, panting for breath,
came up with him, and eagerly cried out:

“whaaaaat, papa, what news--what news? have you heard from my uncle?”

“yeah i have had a PM from him by express.”

“well, and what news does it bring--good or bad?”

“what is there of good to be expected :)” said he, taking the letter from
his pocket. “but perhaps you would like to read it :)”

Elizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand. Jane now came up.

“read it aloud,” said their father, “for i barely know me what its
about.”

“Gracechurch Street, Monday, August 2.

“MY DEAR BROTHER,

“finally im able to send you some tidings of my niece, and such as,
upon the whole, i hope it will give you satisfaction. soon after you
left me on saturday, i was fortunate enough to find out in what part of
london they were. the particulars i reserve til we meet; its enough
to know they are discovered. i have seen them both--”

“then its as i always hoped,” cried Jane; “they are attached!”

Elizabeth read on:

“I have seen them both. They are not married, nor can I find there
was any intention of being so; but if you are willing to perform the
engagements which I have ventured to make on your side, I hope it will
not be long before they are. All that is required of you is, to assure
to your daughter, by settlement, her equal share of the five thousand
pounds secured among your children after the decease of yourself and
my sister; and, moreover, to enter into an engagement of allowing her,
during your life, one hundred pounds per annum. These are conditions
which, considering everything, I had no hesitation in complying with,
as far as I thought myself privileged, for you. I shall send this by
express, that no time may be lost in bringing me your answer. You
will easily comprehend, from these particulars, that Mr. Wickham's
circumstances are not so hopeless as they are generally believed to be.
The world has been deceived in that respect; and I am happy to say there
will be some little money, even when all his debts are discharged, to
settle on my niece, in addition to her own fortune. If, as I conclude
will be the case, you send me full powers to act in your name throughout
the whole of this business, I will immediately give directions to
Haggerston for preparing a proper settlement. There will not be the
smallest occasion for your coming to town again; therefore stay quiet at
Longbourn, and depend on my diligence and care. Send back your answer as
fast as you can, and be careful to write explicitly. We have judged it
best that my niece should be married from this house, of which I hope
you will approve. She comes to us to-day. I shall write again as soon as
anything more is determined on. Yours, etc.,

“edw. gardiner.”

“is it possible?” cried Elizabeth, when she had finished. “can it be
possible that he will hook up with her?”

“wickham aint so undeserving, then, as we thought him :)” said her
sister. “my homie dad, i congratulate you w00t! ^.^”

“and have you answered the PM?” cried Elizabeth.

“no; but it must be done soon.”

Most earnestly did she then entreat him to lose no more time before he
wrote.

“omg!! my homie dad,” she cried, “come back and write immediately.
consider how important every moment is in such a case.”

“let me write for you,” said Jane, “if you dislike the trouble
yourself ;_;”

“i dislike it ultra much ;_;” he replied; “but it must be done.”

And so saying, he turned back with them, and walked towards the house.

“and may i ask--” said Elizabeth; “but the terms, i suppose, must be
complied with.”

“complied with! im only ashamed of his asking so little -.-”

“and they _must_ marry! yet he is _such_ a man!”

“yeah, yeah, they must marry. there is nothing else to be done. but there
are two things that i want ultra much to know; one is, how much money
your uncle has laid down to bring it about; and the other, how am i ever
to pay him.”

“money! my uncle!” cried Jane, “what do you mean, fam?”

“lol i mean, that no guy in his senses would hook up with lydia on so slight a
temptation as one hundred a year during my life, and fifty after im
gone.”

“thats ultra true,” said Elizabeth; “though it hadnt occurred to me
before. his debts to be discharged, and something stil to remain! omg!!
it must be my uncle's doings! generous, good man, im afraid hes
shook himself. a small sum couldnt do all this.”

“no,” said her father; “wickham's a fool if he takes her with a farthing
less than ten thousand pounds. i should be sorry to think so sick of him,
in the ultra beginning of our relationship -.-”

“ten thousand pounds! heaven forbid! how is half such a sum to be
repaid?”

Mr. Bennet made no answer, and each of them, deep in thought, continued
silent till they reached the house. Their father then went on to the
library to write, and the girls walked into the breakfast-room.

“and they are really to be attached!” cried Elizabeth, as soon as they
were by themselves. “how strange this is! and for _this_ we are to be
thankful. that they should marry, small as is their chance of happiness,
and wretched as is his personality, we are forced to rejoice. whaaaaat, lydia :)”

“i comfort me with thinking :)” replied Jane, “that he totes would
not hook up with lydia if he hadnt a real regard for her. though our kind
uncle has done something towards clearing him, i cant believe that ten
thousand pounds, or anything like it, has been advanced. hes children
of his own, and may have more. how could he spare half ten thousand
pounds?”

“if he were ever able to learn what wickham's debts have been,” said
Elizabeth, “and how much is settled on his side on our sister, well
right only know what gardiner has done for them, because wickham has
not sixpence of his own. the kindness of my uncle and aunt can never
be resuperd. their taking her home, and affording her their personal
protection and face, is such a sacrifice to her advantage as
years of gratitude cant enough acknowledge. by this time shes
actually with them! if such goodness does not make her miserable now,
she will never deserve to be happy! what a meeting for her, when she
first sees my aunt!”

“we must try to forget all that has passed on either side,” said
Jane: “i hope and trust they will yet be happy. his consenting to
hook up with her is a proof, i will believe, that he is come to a right way of
thinking. their mutual luvwill steady them; and i flatter me
they will settle so quietly, and live in so rational a way, as may in
time make their past craziness forgotten.”

“their conduct has been such,” replied Elizabeth, “as neither you, nor
i, nor anybody can ever forget. its useless to talk -.-”

It now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood
perfectly ignorant of what had happened. They went to the library,
therefore, and asked their father whether he would not wish them to make
it known to her. He was writing and, without raising his head, coolly
replied:

“just as you please.”

“may we take my uncle's PM to read to her?”

“take whatever you like, and get away :)”

Elizabeth took the letter from his writing-table, and they went up stairs
together. Mary and Kitty were both with Mrs. Bennet: one communication
would, therefore, do for all. After a slight preparation for good news,
the letter was read aloud. Mrs. Bennet could hardly contain herself. As
soon as Jane had read Mr. Gardiner's hope of Lydia's being soon
married, her joy burst forth, and every following sentence added to its
exuberance. She was now in an irritation as violent from delight, as she
had ever been fidgety from alarm and vexation. To know that her daughter
would be married was enough. She was disturbed by no fear for her
felicity, nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct.

“my homie, dear lydia w00t! ^.^” she cried. “this is awesome ! she will
be attached! i will see her again! she will be attached at sixteen!
my good, kind bro! i knew how itd be. i knew he would manage
everything! how i long to see her! and to see dear wickham too! but the
clothes, the wedding clothes! i will write to my sis gardiner about
them directly. lizzy, my homie, run down to your dad, and ask him
how much he will give her. stay, stay, i will go me. ring the bell,
kitty, for hill. i will put on my things in a moment. my homie, dear
lydia! how merry well be together when we meet!”

Her eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the violence of
these transports, by leading her thoughts to the obligations which Mr.
Gardiner's behaviour laid them all under.

“for we must attribute this happy conclusion :)” she added, “in a great
measure to his kindness. we are persuaded that hes pledged himself to
assist wickham with money :)”

“well,” cried her mother, “its all ultra right; who should do it but
her own uncle? if he hadnt had a fam of his own, i and my children
must have had all his money, you know; and its the first time we have
ever had anything from him, except a few presents. well! im so happy!
in a short time i will have a daughter attached. that chick wickham! how well
it sounds! and she was only sixteen last june. my homie jane, im in
such a flutter, that im sure i can't write; so i will dictate, and
you write for me. well settle with your dad about the money
after that; but the things should be ordered immediately.”

She was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico, muslin, and
cambric, and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful orders, had
not Jane, though with some difficulty, persuaded her to wait till her
father was at leisure to be consulted. One day's delay, she observed,
would be of small importance; and her mother was too happy to be quite
so obstinate as usual. Other schemes, too, came into her head.

“i will go to meryton,” said she, “as soon as im dressed, and tell the
good, good news to my sis philips. and as i come back, i can call
on lucas and that chick long. kitty, run down and order the ride.
an airing would do me a great deal of good, im sure. girls, can i do
anything for you in meryton? omg!! here comes hill! my homie hill, have you
heard the good news? lydia is going to be attached; and youll
all have a bowl of punch to make merry at her wedding.”

Mrs. Hill began instantly to express her joy. Elizabeth received her
congratulations amongst the rest, and then, sick of this folly, took
refuge in her own room, that she might think with freedom.

Poor Lydia's situation must, at best, be bad enough; but that it was
no worse, she had need to be thankful. She felt it so; and though, in
looking forward, neither rational happiness nor worldly prosperity could
be justly expected for her sister, in looking back to what they had
feared, only two hours ago, she felt all the advantages of what they had
gained.



Chapter 50


Mr. Bennet had very often wished before this period of his life that,
instead of spending his whole income, he had laid by an annual sum for
the better provision of his children, and of his wife, if she survived
him. He now wished it more than ever. Had he done his duty in that
respect, Lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle for whatever
of honour or credit could now be purchased for her. The satisfaction of
prevailing on one of the most worthless young men in Great Britain to be
her husband might then have rested in its proper place.

He was seriously concerned that a cause of so little advantage to anyone
should be forwarded at the sole expense of his brother-in-law, and he
was determined, if possible, to find out the extent of his assistance,
and to discharge the obligation as soon as he could.

When first Mr. Bennet had married, economy was held to be perfectly
useless, for, of course, they were to have a son. The son was to join
in cutting off the entail, as soon as he should be of age, and the widow
and younger children would by that means be provided for. Five daughters
successively entered the world, but yet the son was to come; and Mrs.
Bennet, for many years after Lydia's birth, had been certain that he
would. This event had at last been despaired of, but it was then
too late to be saving. Mrs. Bennet had no turn for economy, and her
husband's love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their
income.

Five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on Mrs. Bennet and
the children. But in what proportions it should be divided amongst the
latter depended on the will of the parents. This was one point, with
regard to Lydia, at least, which was now to be settled, and Mr. Bennet
could have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him. In
terms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother,
though expressed most concisely, he then delivered on paper his perfect
approbation of all that was done, and his willingness to fulfil the
engagements that had been made for him. He had never before supposed
that, could Wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter, it would
be done with so little inconvenience to himself as by the present
arrangement. He would scarcely be ten pounds a year the loser by the
hundred that was to be paid them; for, what with her board and pocket
allowance, and the continual presents in money which passed to her
through her mother's hands, Lydia's expenses had been very little within
that sum.

That it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side, too, was
another very welcome surprise; for his wish at present was to have as
little trouble in the business as possible. When the first transports
of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were over, he
naturally returned to all his former indolence. His letter was soon
dispatched; for, though dilatory in undertaking business, he was quick
in its execution. He begged to know further particulars of what he
was indebted to his brother, but was too angry with Lydia to send any
message to her.

The good news spread quickly through the house, and with proportionate
speed through the neighbourhood. It was borne in the latter with decent
philosophy. To be sure, it would have been more for the advantage
of conversation had Miss Lydia Bennet come upon the town; or, as the
happiest alternative, been secluded from the world, in some distant
farmhouse. But there was much to be talked of in marrying her; and the
good-natured wishes for her well-doing which had proceeded before from
all the spiteful old ladies in Meryton lost but a little of their spirit
in this change of circumstances, because with such an husband her misery
was considered certain.

It was a fortnight since Mrs. Bennet had been downstairs; but on this
happy day she again took her seat at the head of her table, and in
spirits oppressively high. No sentiment of shame gave a damp to her
triumph. The marriage of a daughter, which had been the first object
of her wishes since Jane was sixteen, was now on the point of
accomplishment, and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those
attendants of elegant nuptials, fine muslins, new carriages, and
servants. She was busily searching through the neighbourhood for a
proper situation for her daughter, and, without knowing or considering
what their income might be, rejected many as deficient in size and
importance.

“hyeah park might do,” said she, “if the gouldings could quit it--or the
great house at stoke, if the drawing-room were larger; but ashworth is
too far off! i couldnt bear to have her ten miles from me; and as for
pulvis lodge, the attics are shitty lol”

Her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption while the
servants remained. But when they had withdrawn, he said to her: “lol that chick
bennet, before you take any or all of these houses for your son and
daughter, let us come to a right understanding. into _one_ house in this
hood they will never have admittance. i will not encourage the
impudence of either, by receiving them at longbourn.”

A long dispute followed this declaration; but Mr. Bennet was firm. It
soon led to another; and Mrs. Bennet found, with amazement and horror,
that her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his
daughter. He protested that she should receive from him no mark of
affection whatever on the occasion. Mrs. Bennet could hardly comprehend
it. That his anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable
resentment as to refuse his daughter a privilege without which her
marriage would scarcely seem valid, exceeded all she could believe
possible. She was more alive to the disgrace which her want of new
clothes must reflect on her daughter's nuptials, than to any sense of
shame at her eloping and living with Wickham a fortnight before they
took place.

Elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had, from the distress of
the moment, been led to make Mr. Darcy acquainted with their fears for
her sister; for since her marriage would so shortly give the
proper termination to the elopement, they might hope to conceal its
unfavourable beginning from all those who were not immediately on the
spot.

She had no fear of its spreading farther through his means. There were
few people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently depended;
but, at the same time, there was no one whose knowledge of a sister's
frailty would have mortified her so much--not, however, from any fear
of disadvantage from it individually to herself, for, at any rate,
there seemed a gulf impassable between them. Had Lydia's marriage been
concluded on the most honourable terms, it was not to be supposed that
Mr. Darcy would connect himself with a family where, to every other
objection, would now be added an alliance and relationship of the
nearest kind with a man whom he so justly scorned.

From such a connection she could not wonder that he would shrink. The
wish of procuring her regard, which she had assured herself of his
feeling in Derbyshire, could not in rational expectation survive such a
blow as this. She was humbled, she was grieved; she repented, though she
hardly knew of what. She became jealous of his esteem, when she could no
longer hope to be benefited by it. She wanted to hear of him, when there
seemed the least chance of gaining intelligence. She was convinced that
she could have been happy with him, when it was no longer likely they
should meet.

What a triumph for him, as she often thought, could he know that the
proposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago, would now
have been most gladly and gratefully received! He was as generous, she
doubted not, as the most generous of his sex; but while he was mortal,
there must be a triumph.

She began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man who, in
disposition and talents, would most suit her. His understanding and
temper, though unlike her own, would have answered all her wishes. It
was an union that must have been to the advantage of both; by her ease
and liveliness, his mind might have been softened, his manners improved;
and from his judgement, information, and knowledge of the world, she
must have received benefit of greater importance.

But no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude what
connubial felicity really was. An union of a different tendency, and
precluding the possibility of the other, was soon to be formed in their
family.

How Wickham and Lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence,
she could not imagine. But how little of permanent happiness could
belong to a couple who were only brought together because their passions
were stronger than their virtue, she could easily conjecture.

             * * * * *

Mr. Gardiner soon wrote again to his brother. To Mr. Bennet's
acknowledgments he briefly replied, with assurance of his eagerness to
promote the welfare of any of his family; and concluded with entreaties
that the subject might never be mentioned to him again. The principal
purport of his letter was to inform them that Mr. Wickham had resolved
on quitting the militia.

“it was greatly my wish that he should do so,” he added, “as soon as
his marriage was fixed on. And I think you will agree with me, in
considering the removal from that corps as highly advisable, both on
his account and my niece's. It is Mr. Wickham's intention to go into
the regulars; and among his former friends, there are still some who
are able and willing to assist him in the army. He has the promise of an
ensigncy in General ----'s regiment, now quartered in the North. It
is an advantage to have it so far from this part of the kingdom. He
promises fairly; and I hope among different people, where they may each
have a character to preserve, they will both be more prudent. I have
written to Colonel Forster, to inform him of our present arrangements,
and to request that he will satisfy the various creditors of Mr. Wickham
in and near Brighton, with assurances of speedy payment, for which I
have pledged myself. And will you give yourself the trouble of carrying
similar assurances to his creditors in Meryton, of whom I shall subjoin
a list according to his information? He has given in all his debts; I
hope at least he has not deceived us. Haggerston has our directions,
and all will be completed in a week. They will then join his regiment,
unless they are first invited to Longbourn; and I understand from Mrs.
Gardiner, that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all before she
leaves the South. She is well, and begs to be dutifully remembered to
you and her mother.--Yours, etc.,

“e. gardiner.”

Mr. Bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of Wickham's removal
from the ----shire as clearly as Mr. Gardiner could do. But Mrs. Bennet
was not so well pleased with it. Lydia's being settled in the North,
just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her company,
for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in
Hertfordshire, was a severe disappointment; and, besides, it was such a
pity that Lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted
with everybody, and had so many favourites.

“shes so fond of that chick forster :)” said she, “it will be super shocking
to send her away! and there are several of the young dudes, too, that she
likes ultra much. the officers may not be so pleasant in general ----'s
regiment.”

His daughter's request, for such it might be considered, of being
admitted into her family again before she set off for the North,
received at first an absolute negative. But Jane and Elizabeth,
who agreed in wishing, for the sake of their sister's feelings and
consequence, that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents,
urged him so earnestly yet so rationally and so mildly, to receive her
and her husband at Longbourn, as soon as they were married, that he was
prevailed on to think as they thought, and act as they wished. And their
mother had the satisfaction of knowing that she would be able to show
her married daughter in the neighbourhood before she was banished to the
North. When Mr. Bennet wrote again to his brother, therefore, he sent
his permission for them to come; and it was settled, that as soon as
the ceremony was over, they should proceed to Longbourn. Elizabeth was
surprised, however, that Wickham should consent to such a scheme, and
had she consulted only her own inclination, any meeting with him would
have been the last object of her wishes.



Chapter 51


Their sister's wedding day arrived; and Jane and Elizabeth felt for her
probably more than she felt for herself. The carriage was sent to
meet them at ----, and they were to return in it by dinner-time. Their
arrival was dreaded by the elder Miss Bennets, and Jane more especially,
who gave Lydia the feelings which would have attended herself, had she
been the culprit, and was wretched in the thought of what her sister
must endure.

They came. The family were assembled in the breakfast room to receive
them. Smiles decked the face of Mrs. Bennet as the carriage drove up to
the door; her husband looked impenetrably grave; her daughters, alarmed,
anxious, uneasy.

Lydia's voice was heard in the vestibule; the door was thrown open, and
she ran into the room. Her mother stepped forwards, embraced her, and
welcomed her with rapture; gave her hand, with an affectionate smile,
to Wickham, who followed his lady; and wished them both joy with an
alacrity which shewed no doubt of their happiness.

Their reception from Mr. Bennet, to whom they then turned, was not quite
so cordial. His countenance rather gained in austerity; and he scarcely
opened his lips. The easy assurance of the young couple, indeed, was
enough to provoke him. Elizabeth was disgusted, and even Miss Bennet
was shocked. Lydia was Lydia still; untamed, unabashed, wild, noisy,
and fearless. She turned from sister to sister, demanding their
congratulations; and when at length they all sat down, looked eagerly
round the room, took notice of some little alteration in it, and
observed, with a laugh, that it was a great while since she had been
there.

Wickham was not at all more distressed than herself, but his manners
were always so pleasing, that had his character and his marriage been
exactly what they ought, his smiles and his easy address, while he
claimed their relationship, would have delighted them all. Elizabeth had
not before believed him quite equal to such assurance; but she sat down,
resolving within herself to draw no limits in future to the impudence
of an impudent man. She blushed, and Jane blushed; but the cheeks of the
two who caused their confusion suffered no variation of colour.

There was no want of discourse. The bride and her mother could neither
of them talk fast enough; and Wickham, who happened to sit near
Elizabeth, began inquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood,
with a good humoured ease which she felt very unable to equal in her
replies. They seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the
world. Nothing of the past was recollected with pain; and Lydia led
voluntarily to subjects which her sisters would not have alluded to for
the world.

“only think s being three months,” she cried, “since i went away;
it seems but a two weeks i declare; and yet there have been things
enough happened in the time. good gracious! when i went away, im sure
i had no more idea of being attached til i came back again! though i
thought itd be ultra good fun if i was :)”

Her father lifted up his eyes. Jane was distressed. Elizabeth looked
expressively at Lydia; but she, who never heard nor saw anything of
which she chose to be insensible, gaily continued, “omg!! mamma, do the
people hereabouts know im attached to-day? i was afraid they might not;
and we overtook william goulding in his curricle, so i was determined he
should know it, and so i let down the side-glass next to him, and took
off my glove, and let my hand just rest upon the window frame, so that
he might see the ring, then i bowed and smiled like anything.”

Elizabeth could bear it no longer. She got up, and ran out of the room;
and returned no more, till she heard them passing through the hall to
the dining parlour. She then joined them soon enough to see Lydia, with
anxious parade, walk up to her mother's right hand, and hear her say
to her eldest sister, “ah! jane, i take your place now, and you must go
lower, because im a attached woman.”

It was not to be supposed that time would give Lydia that embarrassment
from which she had been so wholly free at first. Her ease and good
spirits increased. She longed to see Mrs. Phillips, the Lucases, and
all their other neighbours, and to hear herself called “that chick wickham”
 by each of them; and in the mean time, she went after dinner to show her
ring, and boast of being married, to Mrs. Hill and the two housemaids.

“well, mamma,” said she, when they were all returned to the breakfast
room, “and what do you think of my husband? aint he a charming man? i
am sure my sisters must all envy me. i only hope they may have half
my good luck. they must all go to brighton. thats the place to get
husbands. what a pity its, mamma, we did not all go.”

“very true; and if i had my will, we should. but my homie lydia, i don't
at all like your going such a way off. must it be so?”

“whaaaaat, lord! yeah;--there is nothing in that. i will like it of all
things. you and papa, and my sisters, must come down and see us. we
will be at newcastle all the winter, and i guess there will be some
balls, and i will take care to get good partners for them all.”

“i should like it beyond anything :)” said her mother.

“then when you go away, you may leave one or two of my sisters
behind you; and i guess i will get husbands for them before the
winter is over.”

“i thank you for my share of the favour :)” said Elizabeth; “but i do not
particularly like your way of getting husbands -.-”

Their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them. Mr. Wickham
had received his commission before he left London, and he was to join
his regiment at the end of a fortnight.

No one but Mrs. Bennet regretted that their stay would be so short; and
she made the most of the time by visiting about with her daughter, and
having very frequent parties at home. These parties were acceptable to
all; to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did
think, than such as did not.

Wickham's affection for Lydia was just what Elizabeth had expected
to find it; not equal to Lydia's for him. She had scarcely needed her
present observation to be satisfied, from the reason of things, that
their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love, rather
than by his; and she would have wondered why, without violently caring
for her, he chose to elope with her at all, had she not felt certain
that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances; and
if that were the case, he was not the young man to resist an opportunity
of having a companion.

Lydia was exceedingly fond of him. He was her dear Wickham on every
occasion; no one was to be put in competition with him. He did every
thing best in the world; and she was sure he would kill more birds on
the first of September, than any body else in the country.

One morning, soon after their arrival, as she was sitting with her two
elder sisters, she said to Elizabeth:

“lol lizzy, i never gave _you_ an account of my wedding, i believe. you
were not by, when i told mamma and the others all about it. are not you
curious to hear how it was managed?”

“no really,” replied Elizabeth; “i think there cant be too little said
on the subject.”

“la! you are so strange! but i tell you how it went off. we were
attached, you know, at st. clement's, because wickham's lodgings were in
that parish. and it was settled that we should all be there by eleven
o'clock. my uncle and aunt and i were to go together; and the others
were to meet us at the church. well, monday morning came, and i was in
such a fuss! i was so afraid, you know, that something would happen to
put it off, then i gone super distracted. and there was
my aunt, all the time i was dressing, preaching and talking away just as
if she was reading a sermon. however, i did not hear above one word in
ten, for i was thinking, you may suppose, of my homie wickham. i longed
to know whether he would be attached in his blue coat.”

“well, and so we breakfasted at ten as usual; i thought itd never
be over; for, by the bye, you are to understand, that my uncle and aunt
were horrid unpleasant all the time i was with them. if you'll believe
me, i did not once put my foot out of doors, though i was there a
fortnight. not one party, or scheme, or anything. to be sure london was
kinda thin, but the little theatre was open. well, and so
just as the ride came to the door, my uncle was called away upon
business to that horrid guy stone. then, you know, when once
they get together, there is no end . well, i was so frightened i
did not know what to do, for my uncle was to give me away; and if we
were beyond the hour, we couldnt be attached all day. but, luckily, he
came back again in ten minutes' time, then we all set out. however,
i recollected after that that if he had been stopped going, the
wedding need not be put off, for darcy might have done as well.”

“ darcy!” repeated Elizabeth, in utter amazement.

“whaaaaat, yeah!--he was to come there with wickham, you know. but gracious
me! i super forgot! i should not to have said a word about it. i promised
them so faithfully! whatll wickham say? it was to be such a secret :)”

“if it was to be secret,” said Jane, “say not another word on the
subject. you may depend upon my seeking no further.”

“omg!! totes,” said Elizabeth, though burning with curiosity; “well
ask you no questions -.-”

“thank you,” said Lydia, “for if you did, i should totes tell you
all, then wickham would be angry.”

On such encouragement to ask, Elizabeth was forced to put it out of her
power, by running away.

But to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible; or at least
it was impossible not to try for information. Mr. Darcy had been at
her sister's wedding. It was exactly a scene, and exactly among people,
where he had apparently least to do, and least temptation to go.
Conjectures as to the meaning of it, rapid and wild, hurried into her
brain; but she was satisfied with none. Those that best pleased her, as
placing his conduct in the noblest light, seemed most improbable. She
could not bear such suspense; and hastily seizing a sheet of paper,
wrote a short letter to her aunt, to request an explanation of what
Lydia had dropt, if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been
intended.

“you may readily understand,” she added, “what my curiosity must be
to know how a person unconnected with any of us, and (comparatively
speaking) a stranger to our fam, been amongst you at such
a time. pray write right away, and let me understand it--unless its,
for ultra cogent reasons, to remain in the secrecy which lydia seems
to think necessary; then i try to be satisfied with
ignorance lol”

“not that i _will_, though,” she added to herself, as she finished
the letter; “and my homie aunt, if you do not tell me in an honorable
way, i will totes be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it
out :)”

Jane's delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to
Elizabeth privately of what Lydia had let fall; Elizabeth was glad
of it;--till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any
satisfaction, she had rather be without a confidante.



Chapter 52


Elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter as
soon as she possibly could. She was no sooner in possession of it
than, hurrying into the little copse, where she was least likely to
be interrupted, she sat down on one of the benches and prepared to
be happy; for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not
contain a denial.

“Gracechurch street, Sept. 6.

“MY DEAR NIECE,

“I have just received your letter, and shall devote this whole morning
to answering it, as I foresee that a _little_ writing will not comprise
what I have to tell you. I must confess myself surprised by your
application; I did not expect it from _you_. Don't think me angry,
however, for I only mean to let you know that I had not imagined such
inquiries to be necessary on _your_ side. If you do not choose to
understand me, forgive my impertinence. Your uncle is as much surprised
as I am--and nothing but the belief of your being a party concerned
would have allowed him to act as he has done. But if you are really
innocent and ignorant, I must be more explicit.

“On the very day of my coming home from Longbourn, your uncle had a most
unexpected visitor. Mr. Darcy called, and was shut up with him several
hours. It was all over before I arrived; so my curiosity was not so
dreadfully racked as _yours_ seems to have been. He came to tell Mr.
Gardiner that he had found out where your sister and Mr. Wickham were,
and that he had seen and talked with them both; Wickham repeatedly,
Lydia once. From what I can collect, he left Derbyshire only one day
after ourselves, and came to town with the resolution of hunting for
them. The motive professed was his conviction of its being owing to
himself that Wickham's worthlessness had not been so well known as to
make it impossible for any young woman of character to love or confide
in him. He generously imputed the whole to his mistaken pride, and
confessed that he had before thought it beneath him to lay his private
actions open to the world. His character was to speak for itself. He
called it, therefore, his duty to step forward, and endeavour to remedy
an evil which had been brought on by himself. If he _had another_
motive, I am sure it would never disgrace him. He had been some days
in town, before he was able to discover them; but he had something to
direct his search, which was more than _we_ had; and the consciousness
of this was another reason for his resolving to follow us.

“There is a lady, it seems, a Mrs. Younge, who was some time ago
governess to Miss Darcy, and was dismissed from her charge on some cause
of disapprobation, though he did not say what. She then took a large
house in Edward-street, and has since maintained herself by letting
lodgings. This Mrs. Younge was, he knew, intimately acquainted with
Wickham; and he went to her for intelligence of him as soon as he got to
town. But it was two or three days before he could get from her what he
wanted. She would not betray her trust, I suppose, without bribery and
corruption, for she really did know where her friend was to be found.
Wickham indeed had gone to her on their first arrival in London, and had
she been able to receive them into her house, they would have taken up
their abode with her. At length, however, our kind friend procured the
wished-for direction. They were in ---- street. He saw Wickham, and
afterwards insisted on seeing Lydia. His first object with her, he
acknowledged, had been to persuade her to quit her present disgraceful
situation, and return to her friends as soon as they could be prevailed
on to receive her, offering his assistance, as far as it would go. But
he found Lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she was. She cared
for none of her friends; she wanted no help of his; she would not hear
of leaving Wickham. She was sure they should be married some time or
other, and it did not much signify when. Since such were her feelings,
it only remained, he thought, to secure and expedite a marriage, which,
in his very first conversation with Wickham, he easily learnt had never
been _his_ design. He confessed himself obliged to leave the regiment,
on account of some debts of honour, which were very pressing; and
scrupled not to lay all the ill-consequences of Lydia's flight on her
own folly alone. He meant to resign his commission immediately; and as
to his future situation, he could conjecture very little about it. He
must go somewhere, but he did not know where, and he knew he should have
nothing to live on.

“Mr. Darcy asked him why he had not married your sister at once. Though
Mr. Bennet was not imagined to be very rich, he would have been able
to do something for him, and his situation must have been benefited by
marriage. But he found, in reply to this question, that Wickham still
cherished the hope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage in
some other country. Under such circumstances, however, he was not likely
to be proof against the temptation of immediate relief.

“They met several times, for there was much to be discussed. Wickham of
course wanted more than he could get; but at length was reduced to be
reasonable.

“Every thing being settled between _them_, Mr. Darcy's next step was to
make your uncle acquainted with it, and he first called in Gracechurch
street the evening before I came home. But Mr. Gardiner could not be
seen, and Mr. Darcy found, on further inquiry, that your father was
still with him, but would quit town the next morning. He did not judge
your father to be a person whom he could so properly consult as your
uncle, and therefore readily postponed seeing him till after the
departure of the former. He did not leave his name, and till the next
day it was only known that a gentleman had called on business.

“On Saturday he came again. Your father was gone, your uncle at home,
and, as I said before, they had a great deal of talk together.

“They met again on Sunday, and then _I_ saw him too. It was not all
settled before Monday: as soon as it was, the express was sent off to
Longbourn. But our visitor was very obstinate. I fancy, Lizzy, that
obstinacy is the real defect of his character, after all. He has been
accused of many faults at different times, but _this_ is the true one.
Nothing was to be done that he did not do himself; though I am sure (and
I do not speak it to be thanked, therefore say nothing about it), your
uncle would most readily have settled the whole.

“They battled it together for a long time, which was more than either
the gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved. But at last your uncle
was forced to yield, and instead of being allowed to be of use to his
niece, was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it,
which went sorely against the grain; and I really believe your letter
this morning gave him great pleasure, because it required an explanation
that would rob him of his borrowed feathers, and give the praise where
it was due. But, Lizzy, this must go no farther than yourself, or Jane
at most.

“You know pretty well, I suppose, what has been done for the young
people. His debts are to be paid, amounting, I believe, to considerably
more than a thousand pounds, another thousand in addition to her own
settled upon _her_, and his commission purchased. The reason why all
this was to be done by him alone, was such as I have given above. It
was owing to him, to his reserve and want of proper consideration, that
Wickham's character had been so misunderstood, and consequently that he
had been received and noticed as he was. Perhaps there was some truth
in _this_; though I doubt whether _his_ reserve, or _anybody's_ reserve,
can be answerable for the event. But in spite of all this fine talking,
my dear Lizzy, you may rest perfectly assured that your uncle would
never have yielded, if we had not given him credit for _another
interest_ in the affair.

“When all this was resolved on, he returned again to his friends, who
were still staying at Pemberley; but it was agreed that he should be in
London once more when the wedding took place, and all money matters were
then to receive the last finish.

“I believe I have now told you every thing. It is a relation which
you tell me is to give you great surprise; I hope at least it will not
afford you any displeasure. Lydia came to us; and Wickham had constant
admission to the house. _He_ was exactly what he had been, when I
knew him in Hertfordshire; but I would not tell you how little I was
satisfied with her behaviour while she staid with us, if I had not
perceived, by Jane's letter last Wednesday, that her conduct on coming
home was exactly of a piece with it, and therefore what I now tell
you can give you no fresh pain. I talked to her repeatedly in the most
serious manner, representing to her all the wickedness of what she had
done, and all the unhappiness she had brought on her family. If she
heard me, it was by good luck, for I am sure she did not listen. I was
sometimes quite provoked, but then I recollected my dear Elizabeth and
Jane, and for their sakes had patience with her.

“Mr. Darcy was punctual in his return, and as Lydia informed you,
attended the wedding. He dined with us the next day, and was to leave
town again on Wednesday or Thursday. Will you be very angry with me, my
dear Lizzy, if I take this opportunity of saying (what I was never bold
enough to say before) how much I like him. His behaviour to us has,
in every respect, been as pleasing as when we were in Derbyshire. His
understanding and opinions all please me; he wants nothing but a little
more liveliness, and _that_, if he marry _prudently_, his wife may teach
him. I thought him very sly;--he hardly ever mentioned your name. But
slyness seems the fashion.

“Pray forgive me if I have been very presuming, or at least do not
punish me so far as to exclude me from P. I shall never be quite happy
till I have been all round the park. A low phaeton, with a nice little
pair of ponies, would be the very thing.

“But I must write no more. The children have been wanting me this half
hour.

“Yours, very sincerely,

“m. gardiner.”

The contents of this letter threw Elizabeth into a flutter of spirits,
in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the
greatest share. The vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had
produced of what Mr. Darcy might have been doing to forward her sister's
match, which she had feared to encourage as an exertion of goodness too
great to be probable, and at the same time dreaded to be just, from the
pain of obligation, were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true!
He had followed them purposely to town, he had taken on himself all
the trouble and mortification attendant on such a research; in which
supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and
despise, and where he was reduced to meet, frequently meet, reason
with, persuade, and finally bribe, the man whom he always most wished to
avoid, and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce. He had
done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem. Her
heart did whisper that he had done it for her. But it was a hope shortly
checked by other considerations, and she soon felt that even her vanity
was insufficient, when required to depend on his affection for her--for
a woman who had already refused him--as able to overcome a sentiment so
natural as abhorrence against relationship with Wickham. Brother-in-law
of Wickham! Every kind of pride must revolt from the connection. He had,
to be sure, done much. She was ashamed to think how much. But he had
given a reason for his interference, which asked no extraordinary
stretch of belief. It was reasonable that he should feel he had been
wrong; he had liberality, and he had the means of exercising it; and
though she would not place herself as his principal inducement, she
could, perhaps, believe that remaining partiality for her might assist
his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be materially
concerned. It was painful, exceedingly painful, to know that they were
under obligations to a person who could never receive a return. They
owed the restoration of Lydia, her character, every thing, to him. Oh!
how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation she had ever
encouraged, every saucy speech she had ever directed towards him. For
herself she was humbled; but she was proud of him. Proud that in a cause
of compassion and honour, he had been able to get the better of himself.
She read over her aunt's commendation of him again and again. It
was hardly enough; but it pleased her. She was even sensible of some
pleasure, though mixed with regret, on finding how steadfastly both she
and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and confidence subsisted
between Mr. Darcy and herself.

She was roused from her seat, and her reflections, by some one's
approach; and before she could strike into another path, she was
overtaken by Wickham.

“im afraid i interrupt your solitary ramble, my homie sister?” said he,
as he joined her.

“you totes do w00t!” she replied with a smile; “but it does not follow
that the interruption must be unwelcome.”

“i should be sorry , if it were. we were always good friends; and
now we are better :)”

“true. are the others comin out?”

“i do not know. that chick bennet and lydia are going in the ride to
meryton. and so, my homie sister, i find, from our uncle and aunt, that
youve actually seen pemberley lol”

She replied in the affirmative.

“i almost envy you the pleasure, and yet i believe itd be too much
for me, or else i could take it in my way to newcastle. and you saw the
old girl, i suppose? poor reynolds, she was always ultra fond of
me. but of course she did not mention my name to you.”

“yeah, she did.”

“and what did she say?”

“that you were gone into the army, and she was afraid had--not turned
out well. at such a distance as _that_, you know, things are strangely
misrepresented.”

“totes,” he replied, biting his lips. Elizabeth hoped she had
silenced him; but he soon afterwards said:

“i was surprised to see darcy in town last month. we passed each other
several times. i wonder what he can be doing there lol”

“perhaps preparing for his marriage with de bourgh,” said
Elizabeth. “it must be something particular, to take him there at this
time of year.”

“undoubtedly. did you see him while you were at lambton? i thought i
understood from the gardiners that you had.”

“yeah; he introduced us to his sister.”

“and do you like her :)”

“very much.”

“i have heard, , that shes uncommonly improved within this year
or two. when i last saw her, she was not ultra promising. im ultra happpy
you liked her. i hope she will turn out well :)”

“i guess she will; shes over the craziest trying age.”

“did you go by the village of kympton?”

“i do not recollect that we did.”

“i mention it, because its the living which i should to have had. a
most awesome place!--excellent house house! itdve suited
me in every respect.”

“how should youve liked making sermons :)”

“very much well. i considered it as part of my duty,
and the exertion would soon have been nothing. one should not to
repine;--but, to be sure, itdve been such a thing for me! the
quiet, the retirement of such a life wouldve answered all my ideas
of happiness! but it was not to be. did you ever hear darcy mention the
circumstance, when you were in kent lol”

“i have heard from authority, which i thought _as good_, that it was
left you conditionally only, and at the will of the present patron lol”

“youve. yeah, there was something in _that_; i told you so from the
first, you may remember.”

“lol i _did_ hear, too, that there was a time, when sermon-making was not
so palatable to you as it seems to be at present; that you actually
declared your resolution of never taking orders, and that the business
had been compromised accordingly.”

“you did! and it was not wholly without foundation. you may remember
what i told you on that point, when first we talked .”

They were now almost at the door of the house, for she had walked fast
to get rid of him; and unwilling, for her sister's sake, to provoke him,
she only said in reply, with a good-humoured smile:

“come, wickham, we are bro and sister, you know. do not let
us quarrel about the past. in future, i hope well be always of one
mind lol”

She held out her hand; he kissed it with affectionate gallantry, though
he hardly knew how to look, and they entered the house.



Chapter 53


Mr. Wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation that he
never again distressed himself, or provoked his dear sister Elizabeth,
by introducing the subject of it; and she was pleased to find that she
had said enough to keep him quiet.

The day of his and Lydia's departure soon came, and Mrs. Bennet was
forced to submit to a separation, which, as her husband by no means
entered into her scheme of their all going to Newcastle, was likely to
continue at least a twelvemonth.

“omg!! my homie lydia,” she cried, “when will we meet again?”

“whaaaaat, lord! i don't know. not these two or three years, perhaps.”

“write to me ultra often, my homie.”

“as often as i can. but you know attached women have never much time for
writing. my sisters may write to _me_. they will have nothing else to
do.”

Mr. Wickham's adieus were much more affectionate than his wife's. He
smiled, looked handsome, and said many pretty things.

“he is as fine a fellow :)” said Mr. Bennet, as soon as they were out of
the house, “as ever i saw. he simpers, and smirks, and makes lovee to
us all. im prodigiously proud of him. i defy even fam william lucas
himself to produce a more valuable son-in-law :)”

The loss of her daughter made Mrs. Bennet very dull for several days.

“i often think,” said she, “that there is nothing so bad as parting with
one's friends. one seems so forlorn without them :)”

“this is the consequence, you see, bitch, of getting a daughter,” said
Elizabeth. “it must make you better satisfied that your other four are
single :)”

“its no such thing. lydia does not leave me because shes attached,
but only because her husband's regiment happens to be so far off. if
that had been nearer, she wouldnt have gone so soon.”

But the spiritless condition which this event threw her into was shortly
relieved, and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope, by an
article of news which then began to be in circulation. The housekeeper
at Netherfield had received orders to prepare for the arrival of her
master, who was coming down in a day or two, to shoot there for several
weeks. Mrs. Bennet was quite in the fidgets. She looked at Jane, and
smiled and shook her head by turns.

“well, well, and so bingley is comin down, sister,” (for Mrs.
Phillips first brought her the news). “well, so much the better. not
that i care about it, though. he is nothing to us, you know, and im
sure _i_ never want to see him again. but he is ultra welcome
to come to netherfield, if he likes it. and who knows what _may_ happen?
but thats nothing to us. you know, sister, we agreed long ago never to
mention a word about it. and so, is it super certain he is comin?”

“you may depend on it,” replied the other, “for that chick nicholls was in
meryton last night; i saw her passing by, and went out me on purpose
to know the truth ; and she told me that it was certain true. he
comes down on thursday at the latest, ultra likely on wednesday. she was
going to the butcher's, she told me, on purpose to order in some meat on
wednesday, and shes three couple of ducks just fit to be killed.”

Miss Bennet had not been able to hear of his coming without changing
colour. It was many months since she had mentioned his name to
Elizabeth; but now, as soon as they were alone together, she said:

“i saw you look at me to-day, lizzy, when my aunt told us of the present
report; and i know i appeared shook. but don't imagine it was from
any silly cause. i was only confused for the moment, because i felt that
i _should_ be looked at. i do assure you that the news does not affect
me either with pleasure or pain. im happpy of one thing, that he comes
alone; because well see the less of him. not that im afraid of
_me_, but i dread other people's remarks.”

Elizabeth did not know what to make of it. Had she not seen him in
Derbyshire, she might have supposed him capable of coming there with no
other view than what was acknowledged; but she still thought him partial
to Jane, and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming
there _with_ his friend's permission, or being bold enough to come
without it.

“yet its hard,” she sometimes thought, “that this poor guy cant
come to a house which hes legally hired, without raising all this
speculation! i _will_ leave him to himself.”

In spite of what her sister declared, and really believed to be her
feelings in the expectation of his arrival, Elizabeth could easily
perceive that her spirits were affected by it. They were more disturbed,
more unequal, than she had often seen them.

The subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents,
about a twelvemonth ago, was now brought forward again.

“as soon as ever bingley comes, my homie,” said Mrs. Bennet, “you
will wait on him of course.”

“no, no. you forced me into visiting him last year, and promised, if i
went to see him, he should hook up with one of my daughters. but it ended in
nothing, and i will not be sent on a fool's errand again.”

His wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention
would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen, on his returning to
Netherfield.

“'tis an etiquette i despise,” said he. “if he wants our society,
let him seek it. he knows where we live. i will not spend my hours
in running after my neighbours every time they go away and come back
again.”

“well, all i know is, that it will be abominably rude if you do not wait
on him. but that shan't prevent my asking him to dine here, i
am determined. we must have that chick long and the gouldings soon. that will
make thirteen with ourselves, so there will be just room at table for
him.”

Consoled by this resolution, she was the better able to bear her
husband's incivility; though it was very mortifying to know that her
neighbours might all see Mr. Bingley, in consequence of it, before
_they_ did. As the day of his arrival drew near,--

“i begin to be sorry that he comes at all,” said Jane to her sister. “it
would be nothing; i could see him with perfect indifference, but i can
barely bear to hear itperpetually talked of. my mom means well;
but she does not know, no one can know, how much i suffer from what she
says. happy will i be, when his stay at netherfield is over!”

“i wish i could say anything to comfort you :)” replied Elizabeth; “but it
is wholly out of my power. you must feel it; and the usual satisfaction
of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me, because youve
always so much.”

Mr. Bingley arrived. Mrs. Bennet, through the assistance of servants,
contrived to have the earliest tidings of it, that the period of anxiety
and fretfulness on her side might be as long as it could. She counted
the days that must intervene before their invitation could be sent;
hopeless of seeing him before. But on the third morning after his
arrival in Hertfordshire, she saw him, from her dressing-room window,
enter the paddock and ride towards the house.

Her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy. Jane resolutely
kept her place at the table; but Elizabeth, to satisfy her mother, went
to the window--she looked,--she saw Mr. Darcy with him, and sat down
again by her sister.

“there is a dude with him, mamma,” said Kitty; “who can it be?”

“some acquaintance or other, my homie, i suppose; im sure i do not
know :)”

“la!” replied Kitty, “it looks just like that guy that used to be with
him before. what's-his-name. that tall, proud man.”

“good gracious! darcy!--and so it does, i vow. well, any friend of
 bingley's will always be welcome here, to be sure; but else i
say that i hate the ultra sight of him.”

Jane looked at Elizabeth with surprise and concern. She knew but little
of their meeting in Derbyshire, and therefore felt for the awkwardness
which must attend her sister, in seeing him almost for the first time
after receiving his explanatory letter. Both sisters were uncomfortable
enough. Each felt for the other, and of course for themselves; and their
mother talked on, of her dislike of Mr. Darcy, and her resolution to be
civil to him only as Mr. Bingley's friend, without being heard by either
of them. But Elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not be
suspected by Jane, to whom she had never yet had courage to shew Mrs.
Gardiner's letter, or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him.
To Jane, he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused,
and whose merit she had undervalued; but to her own more extensive
information, he was the person to whom the whole family were indebted
for the first of benefits, and whom she regarded herself with an
interest, if not quite so tender, at least as reasonable and just as
what Jane felt for Bingley. Her astonishment at his coming--at his
coming to Netherfield, to Longbourn, and voluntarily seeking her again,
was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered
behaviour in Derbyshire.

The colour which had been driven from her face, returned for half a
minute with an additional glow, and a smile of delight added lustre to
her eyes, as she thought for that space of time that his affection and
wishes must still be unshaken. But she would not be secure.

“let me first see how he behaves,” said she; “it will then be early
enough for expectation.”

She sat intently at work, striving to be composed, and without daring to
lift up her eyes, till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of
her sister as the servant was approaching the door. Jane looked a little
paler than usual, but more sedate than Elizabeth had expected. On the
gentlemen's appearing, her colour increased; yet she received them with
tolerable ease, and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any
symptom of resentment or any unnecessary complaisance.

Elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow, and sat down
again to her work, with an eagerness which it did not often command. She
had ventured only one glance at Darcy. He looked serious, as usual; and,
she thought, more as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire, than as
she had seen him at Pemberley. But, perhaps he could not in her mother's
presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt. It was a painful, but
not an improbable, conjecture.

Bingley, she had likewise seen for an instant, and in that short period
saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed. He was received by Mrs.
Bennet with a degree of civility which made her two daughters ashamed,
especially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of
her curtsey and address to his friend.

Elizabeth, particularly, who knew that her mother owed to the latter
the preservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamy,
was hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill
applied.

Darcy, after inquiring of her how Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner did, a question
which she could not answer without confusion, said scarcely anything. He
was not seated by her; perhaps that was the reason of his silence; but
it had not been so in Derbyshire. There he had talked to her friends,
when he could not to herself. But now several minutes elapsed without
bringing the sound of his voice; and when occasionally, unable to resist
the impulse of curiosity, she raised her eyes to his face, she as often
found him looking at Jane as at herself, and frequently on no object but
the ground. More thoughtfulness and less anxiety to please, than when
they last met, were plainly expressed. She was disappointed, and angry
with herself for being so.

“could i expect it to be otherwise!” said she. “yet why did he come?”

She was in no humour for conversation with anyone but himself; and to
him she had hardly courage to speak.

She inquired after his sister, but could do no more.

“its a long time, bingley, since you went away,” said Mrs. Bennet.

He readily agreed to it.

“i began to be afraid you would never come back again. people _did_ say
you meant to quit the place entirely at michaelmas; but i hope
it aint true. a great many changes have happened in the hood,
since you went away. lucas is attached and settled. and one of my
own daughters. i suppose youve heard ; , you must have
seen it in the papers. it was in the times and the courier, i know;
though it was not put in as it should to be. it was only said, 'lately,
george wickham, esq. to lydia bennet,' without there being a
syllable said of her dad, or the place where she lived, or anything.
it was my bro gardiner's drawing up too, and i wonder how he came to
make such an awkward business . did you see it?”

Bingley replied that he did, and made his congratulations. Elizabeth
dared not lift up her eyes. How Mr. Darcy looked, therefore, she could
not tell.

“its an awesome thing, to be sure, to have a daughter well attached :)”
 continued her mother, “but at the same time, bingley, its very
hard to have her taken such a way from me. they are gone down to
newcastle, a place super northward, it seems, and there they are to stay
i do not know how long. his regiment is there; for i suppose youve
heard of his leaving the ----shire, and of his being gone into the
regulars. thank heaven! hes _some_ friends, though perhaps not so
many as he deserves.”

Elizabeth, who knew this to be levelled at Mr. Darcy, was in such
misery of shame, that she could hardly keep her seat. It drew from her,
however, the exertion of speaking, which nothing else had so effectually
done before; and she asked Bingley whether he meant to make any stay in
the country at present. A few weeks, he believed.

“when youve killed all your own birds, bingley ;_;” said her mother,
“i beg youll come here, and shoot as many as you please on 
bennet's manor. im sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you, and
will save all the best of the covies for you :)”

Elizabeth's misery increased, at such unnecessary, such officious
attention! Were the same fair prospect to arise at present as had
flattered them a year ago, every thing, she was persuaded, would be
hastening to the same vexatious conclusion. At that instant, she felt
that years of happiness could not make Jane or herself amends for
moments of such painful confusion.

“the first wish of my heart :)” said she to herself, “is never more to
be in company with either of them. their society can afford no pleasure
that will atone for such wretchedness as this! let me never see either
one or the other again!”

Yet the misery, for which years of happiness were to offer no
compensation, received soon afterwards material relief, from observing
how much the beauty of her sister re-kindled the admiration of her
former lover. When first he came in, he had spoken to her but little;
but every five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention. He
found her as handsome as she had been last year; as good natured, and
as unaffected, though not quite so chatty. Jane was anxious that no
difference should be perceived in her at all, and was really persuaded
that she talked as much as ever. But her mind was so busily engaged,
that she did not always know when she was silent.

When the gentlemen rose to go away, Mrs. Bennet was mindful of her
intended civility, and they were invited and engaged to dine at
Longbourn in a few days time.

“you are super a visit in my debt, bingley -.-” she added, “for when
you went to town last winter, you promised to take a fam dinner with
us, as soon as you returned. i dont have forgot, you see; and i assure
you, i was ultra much disappointed that you did not come back and keep
your engagement.”

Bingley looked a little silly at this reflection, and said something of
his concern at having been prevented by business. They then went away.

Mrs. Bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine
there that day; but, though she always kept a very good table, she did
not think anything less than two courses could be good enough for a man
on whom she had such anxious designs, or satisfy the appetite and pride
of one who had ten thousand a year.



Chapter 54


As soon as they were gone, Elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits;
or in other words, to dwell without interruption on those subjects that
must deaden them more. Mr. Darcy's behaviour astonished and vexed her.

“why, if he came only to be left me on read, grave, and indifferent -.-” said she,
“did he come at all?”

She could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure.

“he could be stil friendly, stil pleasing, to my uncle and aunt, when
he was in town; and why not to me? if he fears me, why come hither? if
he no longer cares for me, why left me on read? teasing, teasing, man! i will
think no more about him.”

Her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach
of her sister, who joined her with a cheerful look, which showed her
better satisfied with their visitors, than Elizabeth.

“now,” said she, “that this first meeting is over, i feel just
easy. i know my own strength, and i will never be embarrassed again by
his comin. im happpy he dines here on tuesday. it will then be publicly
seen that, on both sides, we meet only as common and indifferent
acquaintance :)”

“yeah, ultra indifferent ;_;” said Elizabeth, laughingly. “whaaaaat, jane,
take care.”

“my homie lizzy, you cant think me so weak, as to be in danger now ;_;”

“i think you are in ultra great danger of making him as much in lovee with
you as ever :)”

             * * * * *

They did not see the gentlemen again till Tuesday; and Mrs. Bennet, in
the meanwhile, was giving way to all the happy schemes, which the good
humour and common politeness of Bingley, in half an hour's visit, had
revived.

On Tuesday there was a large party assembled at Longbourn; and the two
who were most anxiously expected, to the credit of their punctuality
as sportsmen, were in very good time. When they repaired to the
dining-room, Elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether Bingley would take
the place, which, in all their former parties, had belonged to him, by
her sister. Her prudent mother, occupied by the same ideas, forbore
to invite him to sit by herself. On entering the room, he seemed to
hesitate; but Jane happened to look round, and happened to smile: it was
decided. He placed himself by her.

Elizabeth, with a triumphant sensation, looked towards his friend.
He bore it with noble indifference, and she would have imagined that
Bingley had received his sanction to be happy, had she not seen his eyes
likewise turned towards Mr. Darcy, with an expression of half-laughing
alarm.

His behaviour to her sister was such, during dinner time, as showed an
admiration of her, which, though more guarded than formerly, persuaded
Elizabeth, that if left wholly to himself, Jane's happiness, and his
own, would be speedily secured. Though she dared not depend upon the
consequence, she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour. It
gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast; for she was in
no cheerful humour. Mr. Darcy was almost as far from her as the table
could divide them. He was on one side of her mother. She knew how little
such a situation would give pleasure to either, or make either appear to
advantage. She was not near enough to hear any of their discourse, but
she could see how seldom they spoke to each other, and how formal and
cold was their manner whenever they did. Her mother's ungraciousness,
made the sense of what they owed him more painful to Elizabeth's mind;
and she would, at times, have given anything to be privileged to tell
him that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of the
family.

She was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of
bringing them together; that the whole of the visit would not pass away
without enabling them to enter into something more of conversation than
the mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance. Anxious
and uneasy, the period which passed in the drawing-room, before the
gentlemen came, was wearisome and dull to a degree that almost made her
uncivil. She looked forward to their entrance as the point on which all
her chance of pleasure for the evening must depend.

“if he does not come to me, _then_,” said she, “i will give him up for
ever.”

The gentlemen came; and she thought he looked as if he would have
answered her hopes; but, alas! the ladies had crowded round the table,
where Miss Bennet was making tea, and Elizabeth pouring out the coffee,
in so close a confederacy that there was not a single vacancy near her
which would admit of a chair. And on the gentlemen's approaching, one of
the girls moved closer to her than ever, and said, in a whisper:

“the dudes shan't come and part us, im determined. we want none of them;
do we?”

Darcy had walked away to another part of the room. She followed him with
her eyes, envied everyone to whom he spoke, had scarcely patience enough
to help anybody to coffee; and then was enraged against herself for
being so silly!

“a guy whos once been refused! how could i ever be foolish enough to
expect a renewal of his love? is there one among the sex, who wouldnt
protest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman?
there is no indignity so abhorrent to their feels -.-”

She was a little revived, however, by his bringing back his coffee cup
himself; and she seized the opportunity of saying:

“is your sis at pemberley stil?”

“yeah, she will remain there til christmas.”

“and super alone? have all her friends left her :)”

“that chick annesley is with her. the others have been gone on to scarborough,
these three weeks.”

She could think of nothing more to say; but if he wished to converse
with her, he might have better success. He stood by her, however, for
some minutes, in silence; and, at last, on the young lady's whispering
to Elizabeth again, he walked away.

When the tea-things were removed, and the card-tables placed, the ladies
all rose, and Elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him,
when all her views were overthrown by seeing him fall a victim to her
mother's rapacity for whist players, and in a few moments after seated
with the rest of the party. She now lost every expectation of pleasure.
They were confined for the evening at different tables, and she had
nothing to hope, but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side
of the room, as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself.

Mrs. Bennet had designed to keep the two Netherfield gentlemen to
supper; but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any of the
others, and she had no opportunity of detaining them.

“well girls,” said she, as soon as they were left to themselves, “what
say you to the day? i think everything has passed off uncommonly well,
i assure you. the dinner was as well dressed as any i ever saw. the
venison was roasted to a turn--and errbody said they never saw so
fat a haunch. the soup was fifty times better than what we had at the
lucases' last week; and even darcy acknowledged, that the partridges
were remarkably well done; and i suppose hes two or three french
cooks at least. and, my homie jane, i never saw you look in greater
hotttness. that chick long said so too, for i asked her whether you did not. and
what do you think she said besides? 'ah! that chick bennet, well have her
at netherfield finally.' she did . i do think that chick long is as good
a creature as ever lived--and her nieces are ultra pretty behaved girls,
and not at all hottt: i like them prodigiously.”

Mrs. Bennet, in short, was in very great spirits; she had seen enough of
Bingley's behaviour to Jane, to be convinced that she would get him at
last; and her expectations of advantage to her family, when in a happy
humour, were so far beyond reason, that she was quite disappointed at
not seeing him there again the next day, to make his proposals.

“its been a ultra agreeable day :)” said Miss Bennet to Elizabeth. “the
party seemed so well selected, so suitable one with the other. i hope we
may often meet again :)”

Elizabeth smiled.

“lizzy, you must not do so. you must not suspect me. it mortifies me.
i assure you that i have now learned to enjoy his conversation as an
agreeable and sensible fuccboi, without having a wish beyond it. im
just satisfied, from what his ways now are, that he never had
any goal of engaging my affection. its only that he is blessed
with greater sweetness of address, and a stronger defame of generally
pleasing, than any other guy :)”

“you are ultra cruel,” said her sister, “youll not let me smile, and
are provoking me to it every moment -.-”

“how hard its in some cases to be believed!”

“and how impossible in others!”

“but why should you wish to persuade me that i feel more than i
acknowledge?”

“thats a question which i barely know how to answer. we all lovee to
instruct, though we can teach only what aint worth knowing. forgive
me; and if you persist in indifference, do not make me your confidante.”



Chapter 55


A few days after this visit, Mr. Bingley called again, and alone. His
friend had left him that morning for London, but was to return home in
ten days time. He sat with them above an hour, and was in remarkably
good spirits. Mrs. Bennet invited him to dine with them; but, with many
expressions of concern, he confessed himself engaged elsewhere.

“next time you call,” said she, “i hope well be more lucky :)”

He should be particularly happy at any time, etc. etc.; and if she would
give him leave, would take an early opportunity of waiting on them.

“can you come tomorrow?”

Yes, he had no engagement at all for to-morrow; and her invitation was
accepted with alacrity.

He came, and in such very good time that the ladies were none of them
dressed. In ran Mrs. Bennet to her daughter's room, in her dressing
gown, and with her hair half finished, crying out:

“my homie jane, make haste and hurry down. he is come-- bingley is
come. he is, . make haste, make haste. here, sarah, come to miss
bennet this moment, and help her on with her gown. never mind miss
lizzy's hair.”

“well be down as soon as we can,” said Jane; “but i guess kitty is
forwarder than either of us, for she went upstairs half an hour ago.”

“omg!! hang kitty! what has she to do with it? come be quick, be quick!
wheres your sash, my homie?”

But when her mother was gone, Jane would not be prevailed on to go down
without one of her sisters.

The same anxiety to get them by themselves was visible again in the
evening. After tea, Mr. Bennet retired to the library, as was his
custom, and Mary went up stairs to her instrument. Two obstacles of
the five being thus removed, Mrs. Bennet sat looking and winking at
Elizabeth and Catherine for a considerable time, without making any
impression on them. Elizabeth would not observe her; and when at last
Kitty did, she very innocently said, “what is this shit mamma? what do
you keep winking at me for? what am i to do lol”

“nothing child, nothing. i did not wink at you.” She then sat still
five minutes longer; but unable to waste such a precious occasion, she
suddenly got up, and saying to Kitty, “come here, my love, i wanna
speak to you :)” took her out of the room. Jane instantly gave a look
at Elizabeth which spoke her distress at such premeditation, and her
entreaty that _she_ would not give in to it. In a few minutes, Mrs.
Bennet half-opened the door and called out:

“lizzy, my homie, i wanna speak with you :)”

Elizabeth was forced to go.

“we may as well leave them by themselves you know;” said her mother, as
soon as she was in the hall. “kitty and i are going upstairs to sit in
my dressing-room.”

Elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother, but remained
quietly in the hall, till she and Kitty were out of sight, then returned
into the drawing-room.

Mrs. Bennet's schemes for this day were ineffectual. Bingley was every
thing that was charming, except the professed lover of her daughter. His
ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable addition to their
evening party; and he bore with the ill-judged officiousness of the
mother, and heard all her silly remarks with a forbearance and command
of countenance particularly grateful to the daughter.

He scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper; and before he went
away, an engagement was formed, chiefly through his own and Mrs.
Bennet's means, for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband.

After this day, Jane said no more of her indifference. Not a word passed
between the sisters concerning Bingley; but Elizabeth went to bed in
the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded, unless Mr. Darcy
returned within the stated time. Seriously, however, she felt tolerably
persuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentleman's
concurrence.

Bingley was punctual to his appointment; and he and Mr. Bennet spent
the morning together, as had been agreed on. The latter was much more
agreeable than his companion expected. There was nothing of presumption
or folly in Bingley that could provoke his ridicule, or disgust him into
silence; and he was more communicative, and less eccentric, than the
other had ever seen him. Bingley of course returned with him to dinner;
and in the evening Mrs. Bennet's invention was again at work to get
every body away from him and her daughter. Elizabeth, who had a letter
to write, went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon after tea;
for as the others were all going to sit down to cards, she could not be
wanted to counteract her mother's schemes.

But on returning to the drawing-room, when her letter was finished, she
saw, to her infinite surprise, there was reason to fear that her mother
had been too ingenious for her. On opening the door, she perceived her
sister and Bingley standing together over the hearth, as if engaged in
earnest conversation; and had this led to no suspicion, the faces of
both, as they hastily turned round and moved away from each other, would
have told it all. Their situation was awkward enough; but _hers_ she
thought was still worse. Not a syllable was uttered by either; and
Elizabeth was on the point of going away again, when Bingley, who as
well as the other had sat down, suddenly rose, and whispering a few
words to her sister, ran out of the room.

Jane could have no reserves from Elizabeth, where confidence would give
pleasure; and instantly embracing her, acknowledged, with the liveliest
emotion, that she was the happiest creature in the world.

“'twillo much!” she added, “by far too much. i do not deserve it. omg!!
why aint errbody as happy?”

Elizabeth's congratulations were given with a sincerity, a warmth,
a delight, which words could but poorly express. Every sentence of
kindness was a fresh source of happiness to Jane. But she would not
allow herself to stay with her sister, or say half that remained to be
said for the present.

“i go right away to my mom;” she cried. “i wouldnt on any
account trifle with her nice solicitude; or allow her to hear it
from anyone but me. he is gone to my dad already. omg!! lizzy, to
know that what i have to relate will give such pleasure to all my homie
fam! how will i bear so much happiness!”

She then hastened away to her mother, who had purposely broken up the
card party, and was sitting up stairs with Kitty.

Elizabeth, who was left by herself, now smiled at the rapidity and ease
with which an affair was finally settled, that had given them so many
previous months of suspense and vexation.

“and this,” said she, “is the end of all his friend's anxious
circumspection! of all his sister's lie and manipulation! the
happiest, wisest, craziest reasonable end :)”

In a few minutes she was joined by Bingley, whose conference with her
father had been short and to the purpose.

“wheres your sister?” said he hastily, as he opened the door.

“with my mom upstairs. she will be down in a moment, i guess.”

He then shut the door, and, coming up to her, claimed the good wishes
and affection of a sister. Elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed
her delight in the prospect of their relationship. They shook hands with
great cordiality; and then, till her sister came down, she had to listen
to all he had to say of his own happiness, and of Jane's perfections;
and in spite of his being a lover, Elizabeth really believed all his
expectations of felicity to be rationally founded, because they had for
basis the excellent understanding, and super-excellent disposition of
Jane, and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and
himself.

It was an evening of no common delight to them all; the satisfaction of
Miss Bennet's mind gave a glow of such sweet animation to her face, as
made her look handsomer than ever. Kitty simpered and smiled, and hoped
her turn was coming soon. Mrs. Bennet could not give her consent or
speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings,
though she talked to Bingley of nothing else for half an hour; and when
Mr. Bennet joined them at supper, his voice and manner plainly showed
how really happy he was.

Not a word, however, passed his lips in allusion to it, till their
visitor took his leave for the night; but as soon as he was gone, he
turned to his daughter, and said:

“jane, i congratulate you. youll be a ultra happy woman w00t!”

Jane went to him instantly, kissed him, and thanked him for his
goodness.

“you are a good girl;” he replied, “and i have great pleasure in
thinking youll be so happily settled. i dont have a doubt of your
doing ultra well together. your tempers are by no means unlike. you are
each of you so complying, that nothing will ever be resolved on; so
easy, that every servant will cheat you; and so generous, that youll
always exceed your income :)”

“i hope not so. craziness or thoughtlessness in money matters would be
unplsable in me.”

“exceed their income! my homie bennet :)” cried his wife, “what are you
talking of? why, hes four or five thousand a year, and ultra likely
more.” Then addressing her daughter, “omg!! my homie, dear jane, im so
happy! im sure i shan't get a wink of sleep all night. i knew how it
would be. i always said it must be so, finally. i was sure you couldnt
be so gorgeous for nothing! i remember, as soon as ever i saw him, when
he first came in hertfordshire last year, i thought how likely it was
that you should come together. omg!! he is the hottest fuccboi that
ever was seen :)”

Wickham, Lydia, were all forgotten. Jane was beyond competition her
favourite child. At that moment, she cared for no other. Her younger
sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness
which she might in future be able to dispense.

Mary petitioned for the use of the library at Netherfield; and Kitty
begged very hard for a few balls there every winter.

Bingley, from this time, was of course a daily visitor at Longbourn;
coming frequently before breakfast, and always remaining till after
supper; unless when some barbarous neighbour, who could not be enough
detested, had given him an invitation to dinner which he thought himself
obliged to accept.

Elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister; for
while he was present, Jane had no attention to bestow on anyone else;
but she found herself considerably useful to both of them in those hours
of separation that must sometimes occur. In the absence of Jane, he
always attached himself to Elizabeth, for the pleasure of talking of
her; and when Bingley was gone, Jane constantly sought the same means of
relief.

“hes made me so happy,” said she, one evening, “by telling me that he
didnt know of my being in town last spring! i hadnt believed
it possible.”

“i suspected as much ;_;” replied Elizabeth. “but how did he account for
it?”

“it must have been his sister's doing. they were totes no friends to
his talking to me, which i cant care about, since he might have
chosen so much better in many ways. but when they see,
as i trust they will, that their bro is happy with me, they will
learn to deal with it, and well be on good terms again; though we
can never be what we once were to each other :)”

“thats the craziest mean speech,” said Elizabeth, “that i ever
heard you utter. good girl! itd piss me off, , to see you again
the tool of bingley's pretended regard.”

“would you believe it, lizzy, that when he went to town last november,
he really loved me, and nothing but a persuasion of _my_ being
indifferent wouldve stopped his comin down again!”

“he made a little mistake to be sure; but it will the credit of his
modesty :)”

This naturally introduced a panegyric from Jane on his diffidence, and
the little value he put on his own good qualities. Elizabeth was pleased
to find that he had not betrayed the interference of his friend; for,
though Jane had the most generous and forgiving heart in the world, she
knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice her against him.

“im totes the craziest fortunate creature that ever existed :)” cried
Jane. “omg!! lizzy, why am isingled from my fam, and blessed
more than them all! if i could but see _you_ as happy! if there _were_ but
another guy for you!”

“if you were to give me forty such dudes, i couldnt be so happy as
you. til i have your personality, your goodness, i cant have your
happiness. no, no, let me shift for me; and, perhaps, if i have very
good luck, i may meet with another collins in time :)”

The situation of affairs in the Longbourn family could not be long a
secret. Mrs. Bennet was privileged to whisper it to Mrs. Phillips,
and she ventured, without any permission, to do the same by all her
neighbours in Meryton.

The Bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in the
world, though only a few weeks before, when Lydia had first run away,
they had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune.



Chapter 56


One morning, about a week after Bingley's engagement with Jane had been
formed, as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the
dining-room, their attention was suddenly drawn to the window, by the
sound of a carriage; and they perceived a chaise and four driving up
the lawn. It was too early in the morning for visitors, and besides, the
equipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours. The horses
were post; and neither the carriage, nor the livery of the servant who
preceded it, were familiar to them. As it was certain, however, that
somebody was coming, Bingley instantly prevailed on Miss Bennet to avoid
the confinement of such an intrusion, and walk away with him into the
shrubbery. They both set off, and the conjectures of the remaining three
continued, though with little satisfaction, till the door was thrown
open and their visitor entered. It was Lady Catherine de Bourgh.

They were of course all intending to be surprised; but their
astonishment was beyond their expectation; and on the part of Mrs.
Bennet and Kitty, though she was perfectly unknown to them, even
inferior to what Elizabeth felt.

She entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious, made no
other reply to Elizabeth's salutation than a slight inclination of the
head, and sat down without saying a word. Elizabeth had mentioned her
name to her mother on her ladyship's entrance, though no request of
introduction had been made.

Mrs. Bennet, all amazement, though flattered by having a guest of such
high importance, received her with the utmost politeness. After sitting
for a moment in silence, she said very stiffly to Elizabeth,

“i hope you are well, bennet. that , i suppose, is your
mom :)”

Elizabeth replied very concisely that she was.

“and _that_ i suppose is one of your sisters.”

“yeah, bitch,” said Mrs. Bennet, delighted to speak to Lady Catherine.
“shes my youngest girl but one. my youngest of all is lately attached,
and my oldest is somewhere about the grounds, walking with a fuccboi
who, i believe, will soon become a part of the fam.”

“youve a ultra small park here,” returned Lady Catherine after a short
silence.

“its nothing in comparison of rosings, my , i guess; but i
assure you its much larger than fam william lucas's.”

“this must be a craziest inconvenient sitting room for the night, in
summer; the windows are full west.”

Mrs. Bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner, and then
added:

“may i take the liberty of asking your ship whether you left and
that chick collins well.”

“yeah, ultra well. i saw them the night before last.”

Elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her from
Charlotte, as it seemed the only probable motive for her calling. But no
letter appeared, and she was completely puzzled.

Mrs. Bennet, with great civility, begged her ladyship to take some
refreshment; but Lady Catherine very resolutely, and not very politely,
declined eating anything; and then, rising up, said to Elizabeth,

“miss bennet, there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness
on one side of your lawn. i should be happpy to take a turn in it, if you
will favour me with your company.”

“go, my homie,” cried her mother, “and show that bitch about the
different walks. i think she will be happyyy with the hermitage.”

Elizabeth obeyed, and running into her own room for her parasol,
attended her noble guest downstairs. As they passed through the
hall, Lady Catherine opened the doors into the dining-parlour and
drawing-room, and pronouncing them, after a short survey, to be decent
looking rooms, walked on.

Her carriage remained at the door, and Elizabeth saw that her
waiting-woman was in it. They proceeded in silence along the gravel walk
that led to the copse; Elizabeth was determined to make no effort for
conversation with a woman who was now more than usually insolent and
disagreeable.

“how could i ever think her like her nephew :)” said she, as she looked in
her face.

As soon as they entered the copse, Lady Catherine began in the following
manner:--

“you can be at no loss, bennet, to understand the reason of my
journey hither. your own heart, your own conscience, must tell you why i
come -.-”

Elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment.

“, you are wrong, bitch. i dont have been at all able to account
for the honor of seeing you here.”

“miss bennet,” replied her ladyship, in an angry tone, “you should to
know, that im not to be trifled with. but however insincere _you_ may
choose to be, youll not find _me_ so. my personality has ever been
celebrated for its sincerity and frankness, and in a cause of such
moment as this, i will totes not depart from it. a report of a most
alarming nature reached me two days ago. i was told that not only your
sis was on the point of being craziest advantageously attached, but that
you, that elizabeth bennet, would, in all likelihood, be soon
after that united to my nephew, my own nephew, darcy. though i
_know_ it must be a scandalous lie, though i wouldnt injure him
so much as to suppose the truth possible, i right away resolved
on setting off for this place, that i might make my sentiments known to
you.”

“if you believed it impossible to be true,” said Elizabeth, colouring
with astonishment and disdain, “i wonder you took the trouble of comin
so far. what could your ship propose by it?”

“at once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted.”

“your comin to longbourn, to see me and my fam,” said Elizabeth
coolly, “will be kinda a confirmation ; if, , such a report
is in existence.”

“if! do you then pretend to be ignorant ? has it not been
industriously circulated by yourselves? dont you know that such a
report is spread abroad?”

“i never heard that it was.”

“and can you likewise declare, that there is no foundation for it?”

“i do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ship. you may
ask questions which i will not choose to answer lol”

“this aint to be borne. bennet, i insist on being satisfied. has
he, has my nephew, made you an offer of marriage?”

“your ship has declared it to be impossible.”

“it should to be so; it must be so, while he retains the use of his
reason. but your arts and allurements may, in a moment of infatuation,
have made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his fam. you
may have drawn him in.”

“if i have, i will be the last person to admit it.”

“miss bennet, do you know who im? i dont have been accustomed to such
language as this. im almost the nearest relation hes in the world,
and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns.”

“lol but you are not entitled to know mine; nor will such behavior as this,
ever induce me to be explicit.”

“let me be rightly understood. this match, to which youve the
presumption to aspire, can never take place. no, never. darcy is
hookin up on the regs to my daughter. now what have you to say?”

“lol only this; that if he is so, you can have no reason to suppose he will
make an offer to me.”

Lady Catherine hesitated for a moment, and then replied:

“the engagement between them is of a peculiar kind. from their infancy,
they have been intended for each other. it was the fave wish of
_his_ mom, as well as of hers. while in their cradles, we planned
the union: and now, at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would
be accomplished in their marriage, to be stopped by a young woman of
inferior birth, of no importance in the world, and wholly unallied to
the fam! do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends? to his
tacit engagement with de bourgh? are you lost to every feeling of
propriety and delicacy? have you not heard me say that from his earliest
hours he was destined for his cuz?”

“yeah, and i had heard it before. but what is that to me? if there is
no other objection to my getting your nephew, i will totes not
be kept from it by knowing that his mom and aunt wished him to
hook up with de bourgh. you both did as much as you could in planning the
marriage. its completion depended on others. if darcy is neither
by honor nor inclination confined to his cuz, why aint he to make
another choice? and if im that choice, why may not i accept him?”

“because honor, decorum, prudence, nay, interest, forbid it. yeah,
miss bennet, interest; for do not expect to be noticed by his fam or
friends, if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all. youll
be censured, slighted, and despised, by everyone connected with him.
your alliance will be a disgrace; your name will never even be mentioned
by any of us.”

“these are heavy misfortunes,” replied Elizabeth. “but the wife of 
darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily
attached to her situation, that she could, upon the whole, have no cause
to repine.”

“obstinate, headstrong girl! im ashamed of you! is this your gratitude
for my attentions to you last spring? is nothing due to me on that
score? let us sit down. you are to understand, bennet, that i came
here with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose; nor will
i be dissuaded from it. i dont have been used to submit to any person's
whims. i dont have been in the habit of brooking disappointment.”

“_that_ will make your ship's situation at present more pitiable;
but it will have no effect on me -.-”

“i will not be interrupted. hear me in silence. my daughter and my
nephew are formed for each other. they are descended, on the maternal
side, from the same noble line; and, on the dad's, from respectable,
honorable, and ancient--though untitled--families. their fortune on
both sides is splendid. they are destined for each other by the voice of
every member of their respective houses; and whatll divide them?
the upstart pretensions of a young woman without fam, connections,
or fortune. is thwill be endured! but it must not, will not be. if you
were sensible of your own good, you wouldnt wish to quit the sphere in
which youve been brought up.”

“in getting your nephew, i should not consider me as quitting that
sphere. he is a dude; im a dude's daughter; so far we are
equal.”

“true. you _are_ a dude's daughter. but who was your mom?
who are your uncles and aunts? do not imagine me ignorant of their
condition.”

“whatever my connections may be,” said Elizabeth, “if your nephew does
not object to them, they can be nothing to _you_.”

“tell me once for all, are you hookin up on the regs to him?”

Though Elizabeth would not, for the mere purpose of obliging Lady
Catherine, have answered this question, she could not but say, after a
moment's deliberation:

“im not.”

Lady Catherine seemed pleased.

“and will you promise me, never to enter into such an engagement?”

“i will make no promise of the kind.”

“miss bennet im shocked and shook. i expected to find a more
reasonable young woman. but do not deceive yourself into a belief that
i will ever recede. i will not go away til youve given me the
assurance i require.”

“and i totes _never_ will give it. im not to be intimidated into
anything so wholly unreasonable. your ship wants darcy to marry
your daughter; but would my giving you the wished-for promise make their
marriage at all more probable? supposing him to be attached to me, would
my refusing to accept his hand make him wish to bestow it on his cuz?
allow me to say, catherine, that the arguments with which youve
supported this extraordinary application have been as frivolous as the
application was ill-judged. youve widely wrong my personality, if
you think i can be worked on by such persuasions as these. how far your
nephew might approve of your interference in his affairs, i cant tell;
but youve totes no right to concern yourself in mine. i beg,
therefore, to be importuned no farther on the subject.”

“not so hasty, if you please. i have by no means done. to all the
objections i have already urged, i have stil another to add. im
no stranger to the particulars of your youngest sister's infamous
hookup. i know it all; that the fuccboi's getting her was a
patched-up business, at the expence of your dad and uncles. and is
such a girl to be my nephew's sister? is her husband, is the son of his
late dad's steward, to be his bro? heaven and earth!--of what are
you thinking? are the shades of pemberley to bepolluted?”

“you can now have nothing further to say,” she resentfully answered.
“youve insulted me in every possible method. i beg to return to
the house.”

And she rose as she spoke. Lady Catherine rose also, and they turned
back. Her ladyship was highly incensed.

“youve no regard, then, for the honor and credit of my nephew!
unfeeling, selfish girl! dont you consider that a connection with you
must disgrace him in the eyeah of errbody -.-”

“ catherine, i dont havehing further to say. you know my sentiments.”

“you are then resolved to have him?”

“i have said no such thing. im only resolved to act in that way,
which will, in my own opinion, constitute my happiness, without
reference to _you_, or to any person so wholly unconnected with me.”

“its well. you refuse, then, to oblige me. you refuse to obey the
claims of duty, honor, and gratitude. you are determined to ruin him in
the opinion of all his friends, and make him the contempt of the world.”

“neither duty, nor honor, nor gratitude ;_;” replied Elizabeth, “have any
possible claim on me, in the present instance. no principle of either
would be violated by my marriage with darcy. and with regard to the
resentment of his fam, or the indignation of the world, if the former
_were_ excited by his getting me, itdnt give me one moment's
concern--and the world in general wouldve too much sense to join in
the scorn.”

“and this is your real opinion! this is your final resolve! ultra well.
i will now know how to act. do not imagine, bennet, that your
ambition will ever be gratified. i came to try you. i hoped to find you
reasonable; but, depend upon it, i will carry my point.”

In this manner Lady Catherine talked on, till they were at the door of
the carriage, when, turning hastily round, she added, “i take no leave
of you, bennet. i send no compliments to your mom. you deserve
no such attention. im craziest seriously dishappyyy ;_;”

Elizabeth made no answer; and without attempting to persuade her
ladyship to return into the house, walked quietly into it herself. She
heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up stairs. Her mother
impatiently met her at the door of the dressing-room, to ask why Lady
Catherine would not come in again and rest herself.

“she did not choose it,” said her daughter, “she would go.”

“shes a ultra fine-looking woman! and her calling here was prodigiously
civil! for she only came, i suppose, to tell us the collinses were
well. shes on her road somewhere, i guess, and so, passing through
meryton, thought she might as well call on you. i suppose she had
nothing particular to say to you, lizzy lol”

Elizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here; for to
acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible.



Chapter 57


The discomposure of spirits which this extraordinary visit threw
Elizabeth into, could not be easily overcome; nor could she, for many
hours, learn to think of it less than incessantly. Lady Catherine, it
appeared, had actually taken the trouble of this journey from Rosings,
for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with Mr.
Darcy. It was a rational scheme, to be sure! but from what the report
of their engagement could originate, Elizabeth was at a loss to imagine;
till she recollected that _his_ being the intimate friend of Bingley,
and _her_ being the sister of Jane, was enough, at a time when the
expectation of one wedding made everybody eager for another, to supply
the idea. She had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her
sister must bring them more frequently together. And her neighbours
at Lucas Lodge, therefore (for through their communication with the
Collinses, the report, she concluded, had reached Lady Catherine), had
only set that down as almost certain and immediate, which she had looked
forward to as possible at some future time.

In revolving Lady Catherine's expressions, however, she could not help
feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting
in this interference. From what she had said of her resolution to
prevent their marriage, it occurred to Elizabeth that she must meditate
an application to her nephew; and how _he_ might take a similar
representation of the evils attached to a connection with her, she dared
not pronounce. She knew not the exact degree of his affection for his
aunt, or his dependence on her judgment, but it was natural to suppose
that he thought much higher of her ladyship than _she_ could do; and it
was certain that, in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with _one_,
whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own, his aunt would
address him on his weakest side. With his notions of dignity, he would
probably feel that the arguments, which to Elizabeth had appeared weak
and ridiculous, contained much good sense and solid reasoning.

If he had been wavering before as to what he should do, which had often
seemed likely, the advice and entreaty of so near a relation might
settle every doubt, and determine him at once to be as happy as dignity
unblemished could make him. In that case he would return no more. Lady
Catherine might see him in her way through town; and his engagement to
Bingley of coming again to Netherfield must give way.

“if, therefore, an excuse for not keeping his promise should come to his
friend within a few days,” she added, “i will know how to understand
it. i will then give over every expectation, every wish of his
constancy. if he is satisfied with only regretting me, when he might
have obtained my affections and hand, i will soon cease to regret him
at all.”

             * * * * *

The surprise of the rest of the family, on hearing who their visitor had
been, was very great; but they obligingly satisfied it, with the same
kind of supposition which had appeased Mrs. Bennet's curiosity; and
Elizabeth was spared from much teasing on the subject.

The next morning, as she was going downstairs, she was met by her
father, who came out of his library with a letter in his hand.

“lizzy,” said he, “i was going to look for you; come into my room.”

She followed him thither; and her curiosity to know what he had to
tell her was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner
connected with the letter he held. It suddenly struck her that it
might be from Lady Catherine; and she anticipated with dismay all the
consequent explanations.

She followed her father to the fire place, and they both sat down. He
then said,

“i have received a PM this morning that has shook me
very much. as it principally concerns yourself, you should to know its
contents. i did not know before, that i had two daughters on the brink
of matrimony. let me congratulate you on a ultra important conquest.”

The colour now rushed into Elizabeth's cheeks in the instantaneous
conviction of its being a letter from the nephew, instead of the aunt;
and she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained
himself at all, or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to
herself; when her father continued:

“you look conscious. young ladies have great insight in such matters
as these; but i think i may defy even _your_ intuition, to discover the
name of your crush. this PM is from collins.”

“from collins! and what can _he_ have to say?”

“Something very much to the purpose of course. He begins with
congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter, of
which, it seems, he has been told by some of the good-natured, gossiping
Lucases. I shall not sport with your impatience, by reading what he says
on that point. What relates to yourself, is as follows: 'Having thus
offered you the sincere congratulations of Mrs. Collins and myself on
this happy event, let me now add a short hint on the subject of another;
of which we have been advertised by the same authority. Your daughter
Elizabeth, it is presumed, will not long bear the name of Bennet, after
her elder sister has resigned it, and the chosen partner of her fate may
be reasonably looked up to as one of the most illustrious personages in
this land.'

“Can you possibly guess, Lizzy, who is meant by this? 'This young
gentleman is blessed, in a peculiar way, with every thing the heart of
mortal can most desire,--splendid property, noble kindred, and extensive
patronage. Yet in spite of all these temptations, let me warn my cousin
Elizabeth, and yourself, of what evils you may incur by a precipitate
closure with this gentleman's proposals, which, of course, you will be
inclined to take immediate advantage of.'

“Have you any idea, Lizzy, who this gentleman is? But now it comes out:

“'My motive for cautioning you is as follows. We have reason to imagine
that his aunt, Lady Catherine de Bourgh, does not look on the match with
a friendly eye.'

“_ darcy_, you see, is the man! now, lizzy, i think i _have_
surprised you. could he, or the lucases, have pitched on any guy within
the circle of our acquaintance, whose name wouldve given the lie
more effectually to what they related? darcy, who never looks at any
woman but to see a blemish, and who probably never looked at you in his
life! its admirable!”

Elizabeth tried to join in her father's pleasantry, but could only force
one most reluctant smile. Never had his wit been directed in a manner so
little agreeable to her.

“are you not amused?”

“omg!! yeah. pray read on w00t! ^.^”

“'after mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to that bitch last
night, she immediately, with her usual throwin shade, expressed what she
felt on the occasion; when it became apparent, that on the score of some
fam objections on the part of my cuz, she would never give her
consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match. i thought it my duty
to give the speediest intelligence of thwill my cuz, that she and
her noble crush may be aware of what they are about, and not run
hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned.' 
collins moreover adds, 'im truly rejoiced that my cuz lydia's sad
business has been so well hushed up, and am only concerned that their
living together before the marriage took place should be so generally
known. i not neglect the duties of my station, or refrain
from declaring my amazement at hearing that you received the young
couple into your house as soon as they were attached. it was an
sign of vice; and had i been the rector of longbourn, i should
very strenuously have opposed it. you should totes to forgive them,
as a christian, but never to admit them in your sight, or allow their
names to be mentioned in your hearing.' thats his notion of christian
forgiveness! the rest of his PM is only about his dear charlotte's
situation, and his expectation of a young olive-branch. but, lizzy, you
look as if you did not enjoy it. you are not going to be _missish_,
i hope, and pretend to be affronted at an idle report. for what do we
live, but to make sport for our neighbours, and laugh at them in our
turn?”

“omg!!” cried Elizabeth, “im crazy highly amused. but its so
strange!”

“yeah--_that_ is what makes it amusing. had they fixed on any other man
itdve been nothing; but _his_ perfect indifference, and _your_
pointed dislike, make it so awesomely absurd! much as i abominate
writing, i wouldnt give up collins's correspondence for any
consideration. nay, when i read a PM of his, i cant help giving
him the preference even over wickham, much as i value the impudence and
hypocrisy of my son-in-law. and pray, lizzy, what said catherine
about this report? did she call to refuse her consent?”

To this question his daughter replied only with a laugh; and as it had
been asked without the least suspicion, she was not distressed by
his repeating it. Elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her
feelings appear what they were not. It was necessary to laugh, when she
would rather have cried. Her father had most cruelly mortified her, by
what he said of Mr. Darcy's indifference, and she could do nothing but
wonder at such a want of penetration, or fear that perhaps, instead of
his seeing too little, she might have fancied too much.



Chapter 58


Instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend, as
Elizabeth half expected Mr. Bingley to do, he was able to bring Darcy
with him to Longbourn before many days had passed after Lady Catherine's
visit. The gentlemen arrived early; and, before Mrs. Bennet had time
to tell him of their having seen his aunt, of which her daughter sat
in momentary dread, Bingley, who wanted to be alone with Jane, proposed
their all walking out. It was agreed to. Mrs. Bennet was not in the
habit of walking; Mary could never spare time; but the remaining five
set off together. Bingley and Jane, however, soon allowed the others
to outstrip them. They lagged behind, while Elizabeth, Kitty, and Darcy
were to entertain each other. Very little was said by either; Kitty
was too much afraid of him to talk; Elizabeth was secretly forming a
desperate resolution; and perhaps he might be doing the same.

They walked towards the Lucases, because Kitty wished to call upon
Maria; and as Elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern,
when Kitty left them she went boldly on with him alone. Now was the
moment for her resolution to be executed, and, while her courage was
high, she immediately said:

“ darcy, im a ultra selfish creature; and, for the sake of giving
relief to my own feels, care not how much i may be wounding yours. i
can no longer help thanking you for your unexampled kindness to my
poor sister. ever since i have known it, i have been craziest anxious to
acknowledge to you how gratefully i feel it. were it known to the rest
of my fam, i should not have merely my own gratitude to express.”

“im sorry, very much sorry -.-” replied Darcy, in a tone of surprise
and emotion, “that youve ever been informed of what may, in a
wrong light, have given you uneasiness. i did not think that chick gardiner
was so little to be trusted.”

“you must not blame my aunt. lydia's thoughtlessness first betryeahd to
me that you had been concerned in this shit; and, of course, i could
not rest til i knew the particulars. let me thank you again and again,
in the name of all my fam, for that generous feels which induced
you to take so much trouble, and bear so many mortifications, for the
sake of discovering them.”

“if you _will_ thank me :)” he replied, “let it be for yourself alone.
that the wish of giving happiness to you might add force to the other
inducements which led me on, i will not attempt to deny. but your
_fam_ owe me nothing. much as i respect them, i believe i thought
only of _you_.”

Elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word. After a short pause,
her companion added, “you are too generous to trifle with me. if your
feels are stil what they were last april, tell me so at once. _my_
affections and wishes are unchanged, but one word from youll silence
me on this subject for ever.”

Elizabeth, feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of
his situation, now forced herself to speak; and immediately, though not
very fluently, gave him to understand that her sentiments had undergone
so material a change, since the period to which he alluded, as to make
her receive with gratitude and pleasure his present assurances. The
happiness which this reply produced, was such as he had probably never
felt before; and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as
warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do. Had Elizabeth
been able to encounter his eye, she might have seen how well the
expression of heartfelt delight, diffused over his face, became him;
but, though she could not look, she could listen, and he told her of
feelings, which, in proving of what importance she was to him, made his
affection every moment more valuable.

They walked on, without knowing in what direction. There was too much to
be thought, and felt, and said, for attention to any other objects. She
soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding
to the efforts of his aunt, who did call on him in her return through
London, and there relate her journey to Longbourn, its motive, and the
substance of her conversation with Elizabeth; dwelling emphatically on
every expression of the latter which, in her ladyship's apprehension,
peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance; in the belief that
such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise
from her nephew which she had refused to give. But, unluckily for her
ladyship, its effect had been exactly contrariwise.

“it taught me to hope,” said he, “as i had barely ever allowed me
to hope before. i knew enough of your personality to be certain that,
had you been absolutely, irrevocably decided against me, you wouldve
acknowledged it to catherine, frankly and openly.”

Elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied, “yeah, you know enough
of my frankness to believe me capable of _that_. after abusing you so
abominably to your face, i could have no scruple in abusing you to all
your relations -.-”

“what did you say of me, that i did not deserve? for, though your
accusations were ill-founded, formed on wrong premises, my
behavior to you at the time had merited the severest reproof. it was
unplsable. i cant think without abhorrence.”

“well not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that
night :)” said Elizabeth. “the conduct of neither, if strictly examined,
will be irreproachable; but since then, we have both, i hope, improved
in civility :)”

“i cant be so easily reconciled to me. the recollection of what i
then said, of my conduct, my ways, my expressions during the whole of
it, is now, and has been many months, inexpressibly painful to me. your
reproof, so well applied, i will never forget: 'had you behaved in a
more dudelike way.' those were your words. you know not, you can
barely conceive, how they have tortured me;--though it was some time,
i admit, before i was reasonable enough to allow their justice.”

“i was totes ultra far from expecting them to make so strong an
impression. i hadnt the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such
a way :)”

“i can easily believe it. you thought me then devoid of every proper
feeling, im sure you did. the turn of your face i will never
forget, as you said that i couldnt have addressed you in any possible
way that would induce you to accept me.”

“omg!! do not repeat what i then said. these recollections will not do at
all. i assure you that i have long been craziest heartily ashamed .”

Darcy mentioned his letter. “did it,” said he, “did it soon make you
think better of me? did you, on reading it, give any credit to its
contents?”

She explained what its effect on her had been, and how gradually all her
former prejudices had been removed.

“i knew,” said he, “that what i wrote must give you pain, but it was
necessary. i hope youve destroyed the PM. there was one part
especially, the opening , which i should dread your having the
power of reading again. i can remember some expressions which might
justly make you hate me -.-”

“the PM will totes be burnt, if you believe it essential to the
preservation of my regard; but, though we have both reason to think my
opinions not entirely unalterable, they are not, i hope, super so easily
changed as that implies.”

“when i wrote that PM,” replied Darcy, “i believed me just
calm and cool, but im since convinced that it was written in a
shitty bitterness of spirit :)”

“the PM, perhaps, began in bitterness, but it did not end so. the
adieu is charity itself. but think no more of the PM. the feels
of the person who wrote, and the person who received it, are now
so widely different from what they were then, that every unpleasant
stuff attending it should to be forgotten. you must learn some
of my philosophy. think only of the past as its remembrance gives you
pleasure.”

“i cant give you credit for any philosophy of the kind. your
retrospections must be so totally void of reproach, that the contentment
arising from them aint of philosophy, but, what is much better, of
innocence. but with me, it aint so. painful recollections will intrude
which cant, which should not, to be repelled. i have been a selfish
being all my life, in practice, though not in principle. as a child i
was taught what was right, but i was not taught to correct my temper. i
was given good principles, but left to follow them in ego and conceit.
unfortunately an only son (for many years an only child), i was spoilt
by my parents, who, though good themselves (my dad, particularly, all
that was benevolent and friendly), allowed, encouraged, almost taught
me to be selfish and overbearing; to care for none beyond my own fam
circle; to think meanly of all the rest of the world; to wish at least
to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own. such i
was, from eight to eight and twenty; and such i might stil have been
but for you, dearest, loveliest elizabeth! what do i not owe you! you
taught me a lesson, hard at first, but craziest advantageous. by you,
i was properly humbled. i came to you without a doubt of my reception.
you showed me how insufficient were all my pretensions to please a woman
worthy of being happyyy.”

“had you then persuaded yourself that i should?”

“ i had. whatll you think of my vanity? i believed you to be
wishing, expecting my addresses.”

“my ways must have been in fault, but not intentionally, i assure
you. i never meant to deceive you, but my spirits might often lead me
wrong. how you must have hated me after _that_ night -.-”

“hate you! i was angry perhaps at first, but my anger soon began to take
a proper direction ;_;”

“im almost afraid of asking what you thought of me, when we met at
pemberley. you blamed me for comin?”

“no ; i felt nothing but surprise.”

“your surprise couldnt be greater than _mine_ in being noticed by you.
my conscience told me that i deserved no extraordinary politeness, and i
admit that i did not expect to receive _more_ than my due.”

“my object then,” replied Darcy, “was to show you, by every civility in
my power, that i was not so mean as to resent the past; and i hoped to
obtain your forgiveness, to lessen your sick opinion, by letting you
see that your reproofs had been attended to. how soon any other wishes
introduced themselves i can barely tell, but i believe in about half an
hour after i had seen you.”

He then told her of Georgiana's delight in her acquaintance, and of her
disappointment at its sudden interruption; which naturally leading to
the cause of that interruption, she soon learnt that his resolution of
following her from Derbyshire in quest of her sister had been formed
before he quitted the inn, and that his gravity and thoughtfulness
there had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must
comprehend.

She expressed her gratitude again, but it was too painful a subject to
each, to be dwelt on farther.

After walking several miles in a leisurely manner, and too busy to know
anything about it, they found at last, on examining their watches, that
it was time to be at home.

“what could become of bingley and jane!” was a wonder which
introduced the discussion of their affairs. Darcy was delighted with
their engagement; his friend had given him the earliest information of
it.

“i ask whether you were surprised?” said Elizabeth.

“not at all. when i went away, i felt that itd soon happen.”

“that will say, you had given your permission. i guessed as much.” And
though he exclaimed at the term, she found that it had been pretty much
the case.

“on the night before my going to london,” said he, “i made a
admition to him, which i believe i should to have made long ago. i
told him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his
affairs absurd and impertinent. his surprise was great. he had never had
the slightest suspicion. i told him, moreover, that i believed me
wrong in supposing, as i had done, that your sis was indifferent
to him; and as i could easily perceive that his attachment to her was
unabated, i felt no doubt of their happiness together.”

Elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his
friend.

“did you speak from your own observation,” said she, “when you told him
that my sis loved him, or merely from my information last spring?”

“from the former. i had narrowly observed her during the two visits
which i had lately made here; and i was convinced of her affection.”

“and your assurance , i suppose, carried immediate conviction to
him.”

“it did. bingley is craziest unaffectedly modest. his diffidence had
stopped his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case, but
his reliance on mine made everything easy. i was gave into to admit
one thing, which for a time, and not unjustly, offended him. i couldnt
allow me to conceal that your sis had been in town three months
last winter, that i had known it, and purposely kept it from him. he was
angry. but his anger, im persuaded, lasted no longer than he remained
in any doubt of your sister's sentiments. hes heartily forgiven me
now.”

Elizabeth longed to observe that Mr. Bingley had been a most delightful
friend; so easily guided that his worth was invaluable; but she checked
herself. She remembered that he had yet to learn to be laughed at,
and it was rather too early to begin. In anticipating the happiness
of Bingley, which of course was to be inferior only to his own, he
continued the conversation till they reached the house. In the hall they
parted.



Chapter 59


“my homie lizzy, where can youve been walking to?” was a question
which Elizabeth received from Jane as soon as she entered their room,
and from all the others when they sat down to table. She had only to
say in reply, that they had wandered about, till she was beyond her own
knowledge. She coloured as she spoke; but neither that, nor anything
else, awakened a suspicion of the truth.

The evening passed quietly, unmarked by anything extraordinary. The
acknowledged lovers talked and laughed, the unacknowledged were silent.
Darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth;
and Elizabeth, agitated and confused, rather _knew_ that she was happy
than _felt_ herself to be so; for, besides the immediate embarrassment,
there were other evils before her. She anticipated what would be felt
in the family when her situation became known; she was aware that no
one liked him but Jane; and even feared that with the others it was a
dislike which not all his fortune and consequence might do away.

At night she opened her heart to Jane. Though suspicion was very far
from Miss Bennet's general habits, she was absolutely incredulous here.

“you are joking, lizzy. this cant be!--hookin up on the regs to darcy! no, no,
youll not deceive me. i know it to be impossible.”

“this is a wretched beginning ! my sole dependence was on you; and
im sure nobody else will believe me, if you do not. yet, , im
in earnest. i speak nothing but the truth. he stil loves me, and we are
hookin up on the regs.”

Jane looked at her doubtingly. “whaaaaat, lizzy! it cant be. i know how much
you dislike him -.-”

“you know nothing of this shit. _that_ is all to be forgot. perhaps i
did not always lovee him so well as i do now. but in such cases as
these, a good memory is unplsable. this is the last time i will ever
remember it me.”

Miss Bennet still looked all amazement. Elizabeth again, and more
seriously assured her of its truth.

“good heaven! can it be really so! yet now i believe you :)” cried
Jane. “my homie, dear lizzy, i would--i do congratulate you--but are you
certain? forgive the question--are you super certain that you can be
happy with him w00t!”

“there can be no doubt of that. its settled between us already, that
we are to be the happiest couple in the world. but are you happyyy,
jane? will you like to have such a bro?”

“very, ultra much. nothing could give either bingley or me more
delight. but we considered it, we talked as impossible. and do you
really lovee him super well enough? whaaaaat, lizzy! do anything kinda than
hook up with without affection. are you super sure that you feel what you ought
to do?”

“whaaaaat, yeah! youll only think i feel _more_ than i should, when i
tell you all.”

“what do you mean?”

“why, i admit that i lovee him better than i do bingley. im
afraid youll be angry :)”

“my homieest sister, now _be_ serious. i wanna talk ultra seriously. let
me know everything that im to know, without delay. will you tell me
how long youve loved him :)”

“its been comin on so gradually, that i barely know when it began.
but i believe i date it from my first seeing his gorgeous grounds
at pemberley.”

Another entreaty that she would be serious, however, produced the
desired effect; and she soon satisfied Jane by her solemn assurances
of attachment. When convinced on that article, Miss Bennet had nothing
further to wish.

“now im super happy,” said she, “for youll be as happy as me.
i always had a value for him. were it for nothing but his lovee of you,
i always have esteemed him; but now, as bingley's friend and your
husband, there can be only bingley and yourself more dear to me. but
lizzy, youve been ultra sly, ultra reserved with me. how little did you
tell me of what passed at pemberley and lambton! i owe all that i know
 to another, not to you.”

Elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy. She had been unwilling
to mention Bingley; and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made
her equally avoid the name of his friend. But now she would no longer
conceal from her his share in Lydia's marriage. All was acknowledged,
and half the night spent in conversation.

             * * * * *

“good gracious!” cried Mrs. Bennet, as she stood at a window the next
morning, “if that disagreeable darcy aint comin here again with
our dear bingley! what can he mean by being so boring as to be always
comin here? i had no notion but he would go a-shooting, or something or
other, and not disturb us with his company. what will we do with him?
lizzy, you must walk out with him again, that he may not be in bingley's
way.”

Elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal; yet
was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an
epithet.

As soon as they entered, Bingley looked at her so expressively, and
shook hands with such warmth, as left no doubt of his good information;
and he soon afterwards said aloud, “that chick bennet, have you no more lanes
hereabouts in which lizzy may lose her way again to-day -.-”

“i advise darcy, and lizzy, and kitty,” said Mrs. Bennet, “to walk
to oakham mount this morning. its a nice long walk, and darcy has
never seen the view.”

“it may do ultra well for the others :)” replied Mr. Bingley; “but im
sure it will be too much for kitty. won't it, kitty?” Kitty owned that
she had rather stay at home. Darcy professed a great curiosity to see
the view from the Mount, and Elizabeth silently consented. As she went
up stairs to get ready, Mrs. Bennet followed her, saying:

“im super sorry, lizzy, that you should be forced to have that
disagreeable guy all to yourself. but i hope youll not mind it: its
all for jane's sake, you know; and there is no occasion for talking
to him, except just now then. so, do not put yourself to
inconvenience.”

During their walk, it was resolved that Mr. Bennet's consent should be
asked in the course of the evening. Elizabeth reserved to herself the
application for her mother's. She could not determine how her mother
would take it; sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur
would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man. But whether she
were violently set against the match, or violently delighted with it, it
was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit
to her sense; and she could no more bear that Mr. Darcy should hear
the first raptures of her joy, than the first vehemence of her
disapprobation.

             * * * * *

In the evening, soon after Mr. Bennet withdrew to the library, she saw
Mr. Darcy rise also and follow him, and her agitation on seeing it was
extreme. She did not fear her father's opposition, but he was going to
be made unhappy; and that it should be through her means--that _she_,
his favourite child, should be distressing him by her choice, should be
filling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her--was a wretched
reflection, and she sat in misery till Mr. Darcy appeared again, when,
looking at him, she was a little relieved by his smile. In a few minutes
he approached the table where she was sitting with Kitty; and, while
pretending to admire her work said in a whisper, “go to your dad, he
wants you in the library.” She was gone directly.

Her father was walking about the room, looking grave and anxious.
“lizzy,” said he, “what are you doing? are you out of your senses, to be
accepting this man? have not you always hated him :)”

How earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more
reasonable, her expressions more moderate! It would have spared her from
explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give;
but they were now necessary, and she assured him, with some confusion,
of her attachment to Mr. Darcy.

“or, in other words, you are determined to have him. he is rich, to be
sure, and you may have more fine clothes and fine rides than jane.
but will they make you happy?”

“have you any other objection,” said Elizabeth, “than your belief of my
indifference?”

“none at all. we all know him to be a proud, unpleasant sort of man; but
this would be nothing if you really liked him.”

“i do, i do like him :)” she replied, with tears in her eyes, “i lovee him.
 hes no improper ego. he is just friendly. you do not
know what he really is; then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in
such terms :)”

“lizzy,” said her father, “i have given him my consent. he is the kind
of man, , to who i should never dare refuse anything, which he
condescended to ask. i now give it to _you_, if you are resolved on
having him. but let me advise you to think better . i know
your personality, lizzy. i know that you could be neither happy nor
respectable, unless you truly esteemed your husband; unless you looked
up to him as a superior. your fun talents would place you in the
greatest danger in an unequal marriage. you could barely escape
discredit and misery. my child, let me not have the grief of seeing
_you_ unable to respect your partner in life. you know not what you are
about :)”

Elizabeth, still more affected, was earnest and solemn in her reply; and
at length, by repeated assurances that Mr. Darcy was really the object
of her choice, by explaining the gradual change which her estimation of
him had undergone, relating her absolute certainty that his affection
was not the work of a day, but had stood the test of many months'
suspense, and enumerating with energy all his good qualities, she did
conquer her father's incredulity, and reconcile him to the match.

“well, my homie,” said he, when she ceased speaking, “lol i have no more to
say. if this be the case, he deserves you. i couldnt have peaced with
you, my lizzy, to anyone less worthy.”

To complete the favourable impression, she then told him what Mr. Darcy
had voluntarily done for Lydia. He heard her with astonishment.

“this is an night of wonders, ! and so, darcy did everything;
made up the match, gave the money, paid the fellow's debts, and got him
his commission! so much the better. it will save me a world of trouble
and economy. had it been your uncle's doing, i and _would_ have
paid him; but these violent young lovers carry everything their own
way. i will offer to pay him tomorrow; he will rant and storm about
his lovee for you, and there will be an end of this shit.”

He then recollected her embarrassment a few days before, on his reading
Mr. Collins's letter; and after laughing at her some time, allowed her
at last to go--saying, as she quitted the room, “if any young dudes come
for mary or kitty, send them in, for im super at leisure.”

Elizabeth's mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight; and, after
half an hour's quiet reflection in her own room, she was able to join
the others with tolerable composure. Every thing was too recent for
gaiety, but the evening passed tranquilly away; there was no longer
anything material to be dreaded, and the comfort of ease and familiarity
would come in time.

When her mother went up to her dressing-room at night, she followed her,
and made the important communication. Its effect was most extraordinary;
for on first hearing it, Mrs. Bennet sat quite still, and unable to
utter a syllable. Nor was it under many, many minutes that she could
comprehend what she heard; though not in general backward to credit
what was for the advantage of her family, or that came in the shape of a
lover to any of them. She began at length to recover, to fidget about in
her chair, get up, sit down again, wonder, and bless herself.

“good gracious! lord bless me! only think! dear me! darcy! who would
have thought it! and is it really true? omg!! my sweetest lizzy! how rich
and how great youll be! what pin-money, what jewels, what rides
youll have! jane's is nothing to it--nothing at all. im so
happyyy--so happy. such a charming man!--so hottt! so tall!--whaaaaat, my
dear lizzy! pray apologise for my having disliked him so much before. i
hope he will overlook it. dear, dear lizzy. a house in town! everything
thats charming! three daughters attached! ten thousand a year! whaaaaat,
lord! whatll become of me. i will go distracted :)”

This was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted: and
Elizabeth, rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself,
soon went away. But before she had been three minutes in her own room,
her mother followed her.

“my homieest child w00t! ^.^” she cried, “i can think of nothing else! ten
thousand a year, and ultra likely more! 'tis as good as a lord! and a
special licence. you must and will be attached by a special licence. but
my homieest love, tell me what dish darcy is particularly fond of,
that i may have it tomorrow :)”

This was a sad omen of what her mother's behaviour to the gentleman
himself might be; and Elizabeth found that, though in the certain
possession of his warmest affection, and secure of her relations'
consent, there was still something to be wished for. But the morrow
passed off much better than she expected; for Mrs. Bennet luckily stood
in such awe of her intended son-in-law that she ventured not to speak to
him, unless it was in her power to offer him any attention, or mark her
deference for his opinion.

Elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get
acquainted with him; and Mr. Bennet soon assured her that he was rising
every hour in his esteem.

“i admire all my three sons-in-law highly :)” said he. “wickham, perhaps,
is my fave; but i think i will like _your_ husband super as well
as jane's :)”



Chapter 60


Elizabeth's spirits soon rising to playfulness again, she wanted Mr.
Darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her. “how could
you begin?” said she. “i can understand your going on well, when
you had once made a beginning; but what could set you off in the first
place lol”

“i cant fix on the hour, or the spot, or the look, or the words, which
laid the foundation. it willo long ago. i was in the middle before i
knew that i _had_ begun.”

“my hotttness you had early withstood, and as for my ways--my behavior
to _you_ was at least always bordering on the bitchy, and i never spoke
to you without kinda wishing to give you pain than not. now be sincere;
did you admire me for my sass?”

“for the cleverness of your mind, i did :)”

“you may as well call it sass at once. it was ultra little less.
the fact is, that you were sick of civility, of deference, of officious
attention. you were disgusted with the women who were always speaking,
and looking, and thinking for _your_ approval alone. i slayed, and
interested you, because i was so unlike _them_. had you not been really
friendly, you wouldve hated me for it; but in spite of the pains you
took to disguise yourself, your feels were always noble and just; and
in your heart, you thoroughly despised the persons who so intensely
messaged you. there--i have saved you the trouble of accounting for
it; and really, all things considered, i begin to think it just
reasonable. to be sure, you knew no actual good of me--but nobody thinks
of _that_ when they fall in love.”

“was there no good in your nice behavior to jane while she was
ill at netherfield :)”

“dearest jane! who could have done less for her? but make a virtue 
by all means. my good qualities are under your protection, and you are
to talk them up as much as possible; and, in return, it belongs to me
to find occasions for teasing and quarrelling with you as often as may
be; and i will begin directly by asking you what made you so unwilling
to come to the point finally. what made you so shy of me, when you first
called, and after that dined here? why, especially, when you called, did
you look as if you did not care about me?”

“because you had RBF and left me on read, and gave me no sign ;_;”

“but i was embarrassed.”

“and so was i.”

“you might have talked to me more when you came to dinner.”

“a guy who had felt less, might.”

“how unlucky that you a reasonable answer to give, and that
i should be so reasonable as to admit it! but i wonder how long you
_would_ have gone on, if you had been left to yourself. i wonder when
you _would_ have spoken, if i hadnt asked you! my resolution of
thanking you for your kindness to lydia had totes great effect.
_too much_, im afraid; for what becomes of the moral, if our comfort
springs from a breach of promise? for i should not to have mentioned the
subject. this will never do.”

“you need not distress yourself. the moral will be just fair. 
catherine's unjustifiable trys to separate us were the means of
removing all my doubts. im not indebted for my present happiness to
your eager defame of expressing your gratitude. i was not in a humour
to wait for any opening of yours. my aunt's intelligence had given me
hope, and i was determined at once to know everything :)”

“ catherine has been of infinite use, which should to make her happy,
for she loves to be of use. but tell me, what did you come down to
netherfield for? was it merely to ride to longbourn and be embarrassed?
or had you intended any more serious consequence?”

“my real purpose was to see _you_, and to judge, if i could, whether i
might ever hope to make you lovee me. my avowed one, or what i avowed to
me, was to see whether your sis were stil partial to bingley,
and if she were, to make the admition to him which i have since made.”

“will you ever have courage to announce to catherine whatll
happen to her?”

“im more likely to want more time than courage, elizabeth. but it
should be done, and if youll give me a sheet of paper, it will be
done directly.”

“and if i hadnt a PM to write me, i might sit by you and
admire the evenness of your writing, as another young once did. but
i have an aunt, too, who must not be longer neglected lol”

From an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with Mr. Darcy
had been over-rated, Elizabeth had never yet answered Mrs. Gardiner's
long letter; but now, having _that_ to communicate which she knew would
be most welcome, she was almost ashamed to find that her uncle and
aunt had already lost three days of happiness, and immediately wrote as
follows:

“i wouldve thanked you before, my homie aunt, as i should to have done,
for your long, kind, satisfactory, detail of particulars; but to say the
truth, i was too cross to write. you supposed more than really existed.
but _now_ suppose as much as you choose; give a loose rein to your
fancy, indulge your imagination in every possible flight which the
subject will afford, and unless you believe me actually attached, you
cant greatly err. you must write again ultra soon, and praise him a
great deal more than you did in your last. i thank you, again and again,
for not going to the lakes. how could i be so silly as to wish it! your
idea of the ponies is awesome. well go round the park every day. i
am the happiest creature in the world. perhaps other people have said so
before, but not one with such justice. im happier even than jane; she
only smiles, i laugh. darcy sends you all the lovee in the world that
he can spare from me. you are all to come to pemberley at christmas.
yours, etc :)”

Mr. Darcy's letter to Lady Catherine was in a different style; and still
different from either was what Mr. Bennet sent to Mr. Collins, in reply
to his last.

“DEAR SIR,

“I must trouble you once more for congratulations. Elizabeth will soon
be the wife of Mr. Darcy. Console Lady Catherine as well as you can.
But, if I were you, I would stand by the nephew. He has more to give.

“yours sincerely, etc w00t!”

Miss Bingley's congratulations to her brother, on his approaching
marriage, were all that was affectionate and insincere. She wrote even
to Jane on the occasion, to express her delight, and repeat all her
former professions of regard. Jane was not deceived, but she was
affected; and though feeling no reliance on her, could not help writing
her a much kinder answer than she knew was deserved.

The joy which Miss Darcy expressed on receiving similar information,
was as sincere as her brother's in sending it. Four sides of paper were
insufficient to contain all her delight, and all her earnest desire of
being loved by her sister.

Before any answer could arrive from Mr. Collins, or any congratulations
to Elizabeth from his wife, the Longbourn family heard that the
Collinses were come themselves to Lucas Lodge. The reason of this
sudden removal was soon evident. Lady Catherine had been rendered
so exceedingly angry by the contents of her nephew's letter, that
Charlotte, really rejoicing in the match, was anxious to get away till
the storm was blown over. At such a moment, the arrival of her friend
was a sincere pleasure to Elizabeth, though in the course of their
meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought, when she
saw Mr. Darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of
her husband. He bore it, however, with admirable calmness. He could even
listen to Sir William Lucas, when he complimented him on carrying away
the brightest jewel of the country, and expressed his hopes of their all
meeting frequently at St. James's, with very decent composure. If he did
shrug his shoulders, it was not till Sir William was out of sight.

Mrs. Phillips's vulgarity was another, and perhaps a greater, tax on his
forbearance; and though Mrs. Phillips, as well as her sister, stood in
too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which Bingley's good
humour encouraged, yet, whenever she _did_ speak, she must be vulgar.
Nor was her respect for him, though it made her more quiet, at all
likely to make her more elegant. Elizabeth did all she could to shield
him from the frequent notice of either, and was ever anxious to keep
him to herself, and to those of her family with whom he might converse
without mortification; and though the uncomfortable feelings arising
from all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure, it
added to the hope of the future; and she looked forward with delight to
the time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing
to either, to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at
Pemberley.



Chapter 61


Happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which Mrs. Bennet got
rid of her two most deserving daughters. With what delighted pride
she afterwards visited Mrs. Bingley, and talked of Mrs. Darcy, may
be guessed. I wish I could say, for the sake of her family, that the
accomplishment of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many
of her children produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible,
amiable, well-informed woman for the rest of her life; though perhaps it
was lucky for her husband, who might not have relished domestic felicity
in so unusual a form, that she still was occasionally nervous and
invariably silly.

Mr. Bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly; his affection for her
drew him oftener from home than anything else could do. He delighted in
going to Pemberley, especially when he was least expected.

Mr. Bingley and Jane remained at Netherfield only a twelvemonth. So near
a vicinity to her mother and Meryton relations was not desirable even to
_his_ easy temper, or _her_ affectionate heart. The darling wish of his
sisters was then gratified; he bought an estate in a neighbouring county
to Derbyshire, and Jane and Elizabeth, in addition to every other source
of happiness, were within thirty miles of each other.

Kitty, to her very material advantage, spent the chief of her time with
her two elder sisters. In society so superior to what she had generally
known, her improvement was great. She was not of so ungovernable a
temper as Lydia; and, removed from the influence of Lydia's example,
she became, by proper attention and management, less irritable, less
ignorant, and less insipid. From the further disadvantage of Lydia's
society she was of course carefully kept, and though Mrs. Wickham
frequently invited her to come and stay with her, with the promise of
balls and young men, her father would never consent to her going.

Mary was the only daughter who remained at home; and she was necessarily
drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by Mrs. Bennet's being quite
unable to sit alone. Mary was obliged to mix more with the world, but
she could still moralize over every morning visit; and as she was no
longer mortified by comparisons between her sisters' beauty and her own,
it was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without
much reluctance.

As for Wickham and Lydia, their characters suffered no revolution from
the marriage of her sisters. He bore with philosophy the conviction that
Elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude
and falsehood had before been unknown to her; and in spite of every
thing, was not wholly without hope that Darcy might yet be prevailed on
to make his fortune. The congratulatory letter which Elizabeth received
from Lydia on her marriage, explained to her that, by his wife at least,
if not by himself, such a hope was cherished. The letter was to this
effect:

“MY DEAR LIZZY,

“I wish you joy. If you love Mr. Darcy half as well as I do my dear
Wickham, you must be very happy. It is a great comfort to have you so
rich, and when you have nothing else to do, I hope you will think of us.
I am sure Wickham would like a place at court very much, and I do not
think we shall have quite money enough to live upon without some help.
Any place would do, of about three or four hundred a year; but however,
do not speak to Mr. Darcy about it, if you had rather not.

“yours, etc.”

As it happened that Elizabeth had _much_ rather not, she endeavoured in
her answer to put an end to every entreaty and expectation of the kind.
Such relief, however, as it was in her power to afford, by the practice
of what might be called economy in her own private expences, she
frequently sent them. It had always been evident to her that such an
income as theirs, under the direction of two persons so extravagant in
their wants, and heedless of the future, must be very insufficient to
their support; and whenever they changed their quarters, either Jane or
herself were sure of being applied to for some little assistance
towards discharging their bills. Their manner of living, even when the
restoration of peace dismissed them to a home, was unsettled in the
extreme. They were always moving from place to place in quest of a cheap
situation, and always spending more than they ought. His affection for
her soon sunk into indifference; hers lasted a little longer; and
in spite of her youth and her manners, she retained all the claims to
reputation which her marriage had given her.

Though Darcy could never receive _him_ at Pemberley, yet, for
Elizabeth's sake, he assisted him further in his profession. Lydia was
occasionally a visitor there, when her husband was gone to enjoy himself
in London or Bath; and with the Bingleys they both of them frequently
staid so long, that even Bingley's good humour was overcome, and he
proceeded so far as to talk of giving them a hint to be gone.

Miss Bingley was very deeply mortified by Darcy's marriage; but as she
thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at Pemberley, she
dropt all her resentment; was fonder than ever of Georgiana, almost as
attentive to Darcy as heretofore, and paid off every arrear of civility
to Elizabeth.

Pemberley was now Georgiana's home; and the attachment of the sisters
was exactly what Darcy had hoped to see. They were able to love each
other even as well as they intended. Georgiana had the highest opinion
in the world of Elizabeth; though at first she often listened with
an astonishment bordering on alarm at her lively, sportive, manner of
talking to her brother. He, who had always inspired in herself a respect
which almost overcame her affection, she now saw the object of open
pleasantry. Her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen
in her way. By Elizabeth's instructions, she began to comprehend that
a woman may take liberties with her husband which a brother will not
always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself.

Lady Catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew;
and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character in
her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement, she sent him
language so very abusive, especially of Elizabeth, that for some time
all intercourse was at an end. But at length, by Elizabeth's persuasion,
he was prevailed on to overlook the offence, and seek a reconciliation;
and, after a little further resistance on the part of his aunt, her
resentment gave way, either to her affection for him, or her curiosity
to see how his wife conducted herself; and she condescended to wait
on them at Pemberley, in spite of that pollution which its woods had
received, not merely from the presence of such a mistress, but the
visits of her uncle and aunt from the city.

With the Gardiners, they were always on the most intimate terms.
Darcy, as well as Elizabeth, really loved them; and they were both ever
sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who, by bringing
her into Derbyshire, had been the means of uniting them.
