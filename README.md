-To utilize this program: modify the final line (internetify('Texts/pride.txt')) with the path to the desired file (in this case where your copy of the pride and prejudice text file is).  

-From here, run the file (register_transformation.py) and it will output a new file with the same file name as your input file but with an appended ".text.out" extension.  

-Upon renaming this file as a txt file you will have access the transformed text!
